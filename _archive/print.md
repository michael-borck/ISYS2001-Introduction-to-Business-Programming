Let's say Hello

Python, developed by Guido van Rossum in 1991, is loved by beginners and experts alike for its readable code and concise syntax. This language is so versatile that it can power websites, analyze data, build machine learning models, automate tasks, create games, and even control robots! 💻

Writing code in Python is as easy as pie. So let's get coding without any delay!

Check out this snippet that simply prints Hello World! to the screen.

print("Hello World!")

Please pay close attention to the syntax here. Notice the keyword print, the parentheses, and the quotation marks. Got it?

Now it's your turn to print Hello World! to the screen. Please fill in the blanks below. 🖥️

First spell : function
Check out this line of code you just wrote:

print("Hello World!")

In Python, think of print as a magic spell: you write the word print, and voila! ✨ Text appears on your screen.

Now, here's the cool part: you can use this spell over and over again, wherever you need it in your code. In Python language, we call such a spell a function. So, when you see print() with those parentheses, it's like casting the spell to print something to the screen. Cool, right? 😎

Each print() function will print on a new line.

Can you guess the output of the code below?

print("Hello World!")
print("I am learning Python.")

Select one option from the list

I am learning Python.

Hello World! I am learning Python.

Hello World!

Hello World!
I am learning Python.


Print two lines
Now that you're familiar with the basic print function to display text on the screen, let's solidify your understanding by putting it into practice.

Can you please print the following text to the screen using Python?

Python is versatile!
I am learning Python!

💡Hint: Use one print function for each line, and remember to use quotation marks correctly.



Mind the indentation
Even the simplest lines of code can trip you up with sneaky errors. So, we must learn about them to write better code.

One common mistake is extra indentation!

    print("Hello, World!") 

This won't work because of those extra spaces before print.

Can you figure out the error and correct it in the following code?

Can you figure out the error and correct it in the following code?

print("Python is the most versatile language.")
     print("I am learning Python!")



Allergic to case
Watch out! Python is picky about case sensitivity. ⚠️

For example:

PRINT("All caps")

It's like shouting at your computer! 🗣️ Remember, Print, print, and PRINT are all different. The computer will only respond properly if you use print.

Can you please put the right function name in the blank below?

Fill in the gaps with the relevant elements

Can I give you a Nickname?
Oops! Calling a function by the wrong name is another common mistake! 🤦‍♂️

For example:

pint("Hello, World!")

Looks like we’re ordering a drink instead of printing text! 🍺 It should be print, not pint.

Quick Question: Can you fix the typo in the following code?


prin("Learning Python is fun!")


Mark the finish line please
Uh-oh! Looks like we forgot to close our string! 😬

print("Python)

This won't work because it’s like starting a sentence and never finishing it. Here is the corrected one:

print("Python")

Always make sure your strings are properly enclosed in quotes. 📝

Quick Question: Can you fix the missing quote in the following code?

print("Coding is fun)

Mark function area
The last but not least: Don’t leave your parentheses hanging! 🚪

For example:

print("I have no end"

This won’t work because it’s like opening a door and never closing it. The corrected code is:

print("I have no end")

Make sure all your parentheses are matched. ✅

Can you correct the code below, please?

print"I don't know where to start")


Fix some errors
