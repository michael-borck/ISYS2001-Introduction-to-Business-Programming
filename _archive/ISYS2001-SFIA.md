| SFIA Skill | Description | Level | Why/How |
|------------|-------------|-------|---------|
| Programming/software development (PROG) | Designing, coding, verifying, testing, documenting, amending and refactoring programs/scripts. Includes applying agreed standards and tools to achieve well-engineered outcomes. | 2-3 | Core skill for the course; students will be coding in Python throughout |
| Data science (DATS) | Applying mathematics, statistics, data mining and predictive modelling techniques to gain insights, predict behaviours and generate value from data. | 2-3 | Relevant for data analysis with pandas and the weather dashboard project |
| Data visualisation (VISL) | Facilitating understanding of data by displaying concepts, ideas, and facts using graphical representations. | 2-3 | Directly applicable to the data visualisation component using matplotlib |
| Quality assurance (QUAS) | Determining compliance with organisational directives, standards and procedures, and identifying non-compliances, non-conformances and abnormal occurrences. | 2-3 | Relevant for testing and debugging techniques covered in the course |
| Methods and tools (METL) | Ensuring that appropriate methods and tools for the planning, development, testing, operation, management and maintenance of systems are adopted and used effectively throughout the organisation. | 2-3 | Applicable for using Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab, and GitHub |
| Emerging technology monitoring (EMRG) | Identifying and assessing new and emerging technologies, products, services, methods and techniques. | 2-3 | Relevant for the AI-assisted coding aspects of the course |
| Problem management (PBMG) | Identifying and resolving issues to prevent recurrence. | 2-3 | Relevant for debugging and problem-solving techniques in programming |

:This table aligns the SFIA skills with the course content, focusing on the introductory nature of the course (hence the lower skill levels) while covering the key areas of programming, data analysis, visualisation, and the use of various tools and methodologies.{#tbl-sfia-skills}
