        "\n",
        "In this problem, we’re going to find the size of the smallest neighborhood of a collection of villages. We’ll find it helpful to store all of the neighbor- hood sizes. We might have as many as 100 villages, though, and using a sep- arate variable for each village would be a nightmare. We’ll see that lists allow us to aggregate what would otherwise be separate variables into one collection. We’ll also learn about Python’s powerful list operations for modifying, searching, and sorting a list.\n",

        "\n",
        "Each village defines its neighbourhood as all points along the road which are closer to it than to any other village. A point which is equally close to two distinct villages  A and B is in the neighbourhood of A and also in the neighbourhood of A.\n",
        "\n",
        "> That is, the *neighbourhood* consists of half the space between the village and it neighbours.  We count the boundary (mid-point) as being in both villages.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each neighbourhood has a size which is the difference between the minimum (leftmost) point in its neighbourhood and the maximum (rightmost) point in its neighbourhood.\n",
        "\n",
        "The neighbourhoods of the leftmost and rightmost villages are defined to be of infinite size, while all other neighbourhoods are finite in size.\n",
        "\n",
        "Determine the smallest size of any of the neighbourhoods (with exactly 1 digit after the decimal point).\n",

        "* n lines, each of which gives the position of a village. Each position is an integer between –1,000,000,000 and 1,000,000,000.\n",

        "## Output\n",

        "In Data Plan, we read an integer, used it, and never referred to it again. We didn’t need to keep it around. But in Village Neighborhood, it’s not enough to see each integer just once. A village’s neighborhood depends on its left and right neighbors. Without access to those neighbors, we can’t calculate the size of the village’s neighborhood. We need to store all of the village positions for later use.\n",
