## Course Description

This course introduces students to business programming using Python, with a
focus on AI-assisted coding techniques. Students will learn practical
applications in data analysis, automation, and visualisation while leveraging AI
tools to enhance their coding skills. The course utilises Jupyter Notebooks,
Google Colab, and GitHub for collaborative coding and version control,
integrating AI-powered coding assistants throughout the learning process. The
course culminates in an AI-assisted project that lays the foundation for
advanced development in the subsequent Business Development course.

## Weekly Schedule

1. Introduction to Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and AI-assisted coding tools
2. Basic Python syntax, data types, and AI-generated code snippets
3. Control structures, functions, and AI-powered code completion
4. Lists, dictionaries, file handling, and AI-assisted debugging
5. Introduction to data analysis with pandas and AI-enhanced data cleaning
6. Data visualisation with matplotlib and AI-suggested plot improvements
7. Web scraping basics with AI-assisted parsing techniques
8. Introduction to API usage and AI-powered API integration
9. Introduction to VSCode, script development, and AI code refactoring
10. Project work: Developing a modular dashboard application with AI assistance
11. AI-enhanced testing and debugging techniques
12. Final project presentations and AI-assisted code review

## Project Focus

Students will develop a modular dashboard application (e.g., for weather data or
stock market analysis) using functional programming paradigms and AI-assisted
coding techniques. This project will serve as the foundation for further
development in the advanced course, demonstrating the integration of AI tools in
the software development process.


## Assessment and Project Integration

1. **Modular Library Development** In the introductory course, students will
   create a modular library for data retrieval and processing. In the advanced
   course, they will refactor this library using OOP principles and expand its
   functionality.

2. **Open Source Contribution** Introduce students to open source contribution
   in the advanced course by having them contribute to a class-wide open source
   project hosted on GitHub. This project could be an extension of their
   dashboard applications or a new collaborative project.

3. **Code Review and Collaboration** Implement peer code reviews in both
   courses, with more advanced techniques introduced in the second course. This
   will help students understand the importance of code quality and
   collaboration in software development.

4. **Portfolio Development** Encourage students to maintain a portfolio of their
   projects on GitHub, starting from the introductory course and expanding it in
   the advanced course. This will showcase their progress and provide a valuable
   resource for future job searches.

5. **Industry-Inspired Challenges** Introduce real-world programming challenges
   inspired by industry problems in both courses, with increasing complexity in
   the advanced course. This will help students understand the practical
   applications of their skills.

By implementing this plan, students will experience a more cohesive learning
journey across both courses, gaining practical skills that are directly
applicable to real-world business programming scenarios. The gradual
introduction of more advanced tools and concepts will help smooth the transition
between the courses, while the continuous project development will reinforce
learning and demonstrate the students' growing capabilities.

Clarifying "functional programming": In the introductory unit, "functional
programming" refers to using functions rather than the more formal concept of
pure functions. It it important to clarify this for students to avoid confusion
with the more advanced functional programming paradigm.


## Assessment and Project Integration

1. **AI-Assisted Modular Library Development**: Students will create a modular
   library for data retrieval and processing, utilising AI tools for code
   generation and optimisation.

2. **Open Source Contribution with AI Collaboration**: Introduce students to
   open source contribution, incorporating AI-assisted code review and
   improvement suggestions.

3. **AI-Enhanced Code Review and Collaboration**: Implement peer code reviews
   augmented by AI-powered code analysis tools.

4. **AI-Integrated Portfolio Development**: Encourage students to maintain a
   portfolio of their projects on GitHub, showcasing both their coding skills
   and their ability to effectively use AI coding assistants.

5. **Industry-Inspired AI Coding Challenges**: Introduce real-world programming
   challenges that incorporate AI-assisted problem-solving techniques.
