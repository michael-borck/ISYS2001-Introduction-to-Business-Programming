### **Title: Business Simulations with Simulacra**

### **Overview**

In this assignment, you will utilize the Simulacra Python package to conduct simulations across various business scenarios. You will select a simulation type, set parameters to model realistic situations, visualize outcomes, analyze the effects of parameter changes, and extract insights to support decision-making processes. Your work will be compiled in a Google Colab Notebook and saved to a dedicated GitHub repository.

### **Objectives**

- Understand and apply simulation techniques in business contexts.
- Analyze the impact of different variables in simulation models.
- Develop skills in data visualization and interpretation.

### **Assignment Tasks**

#### 1. **Setup:**
   - Create a new GitHub repository specifically for this assignment.
   - Clone the repository in your Google Colab environment to ensure all changes are version-controlled.
   - Install the Simulacra package from our class GitHub repository. Follow the provided setup instructions to prepare your environment for running simulations.

#### 2. **Choose Your Simulation:**
   - Decide which simulation you want to explore:
     - Stock Market Simulation
     - Resource Fluctuations Simulation
     - Product Popularity Simulation

#### 3. **Familiarize Yourself with the Simulation:**
   - Read the detailed documentation for your selected simulation type within the Simulacra package. Understand the role and typical range of each parameter.

#### 4. **Execute the Simulation:**
   - Instantiate your chosen simulation class with initial parameters reflecting a realistic scenario.
   - Execute the simulation by calling the `run_simulation()` method and collect the output data.

#### 5. **Visualize the Simulation Data:**
   - Use various plotting techniques (e.g., line plots, bar charts) to visualize key trends and dynamics within the data.
   - Highlight any significant effects due to specific events or interventions, if relevant.

#### 6. **Analytical Experimentation:**
   - Modify parameters to explore how changes influence simulation outcomes.
   - Analyze key metrics derived from the data (like peak values, averages, variability).
   - Model potential strategies or interventions and assess their impact.

#### 7. **Compile and Report Your Findings:**
   - Assemble your work into a Jupyter Notebook that includes:
     - Code implementations along with detailed comments.
     - Visualizations with captions explaining each figure.
     - A comprehensive analysis section discussing parameter choices, observed results, and their implications.
     - A reflection on the simulation's limitations and suggestions for improvement.
   - Commit regularly to your GitHub repository to maintain a log of your progress.
   - Submit a zip of your GitHub repository to capture all logs for analysis of your commit frequency and development progress.

### **Evaluation Criteria**

- **Functionality and Code Clarity:** Clear, efficient, and well-documented code.
- **Visualization Quality:** Accurate and insightful visual representations of the data.
- **Depth of Analysis:** Thorough exploration and nuanced understanding of how parameter variations affect outcomes.
- **Reflective Discussion:** Insightful discussion on the real-world applicability and limitations of the models.
- **Overall Presentation:** Coherence, logical structure, and professionalism in the presentation of the report.

### **Additional Guidelines**

- **Collaboration Policy:** Collaboration among students is encouraged to foster peer learning, however, all submitted work must be independently created.
- **Exploratory Approach:** You are encouraged to delve deeper into any specific aspects of the simulations that pique your interest. Investigate additional questions or scenarios beyond the basic assignment requirements.
