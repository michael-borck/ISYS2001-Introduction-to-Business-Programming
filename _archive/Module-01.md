# Welcome to the Course!

- Learn Python efficiently and effectively
- Build long-term programming skills
- Engage in hands-on coding
- Make learning fun and interactive

::: {.notes}
Welcome to the course! This isn't just about reading and listening to lectures; it's about actively engaging with Python through coding exercises. By following this approach, you’ll not only learn Python quickly but also retain what you learn for the long term.

# A Flipped Classroom Approach

- Watch short tutorials before class
- Code during class with guidance
- Collaborate with peers
- Immediate feedback for better learning

::: {.notes}
We’re using a flipped classroom model. This means you'll watch short tutorials and read materials before class. Then, in class, you'll apply what you've learned through exercises, discussions, and coding challenges, with the instructor and peers available to help.
:::


# Tools You’ll Use

- **Google Colab** – Cloud-based Python coding
- **GitHub** – Version control & collaboration
- **Class Resources** – Guides, videos, and exercises

::: {.notes}
We’ll use Google Colab for coding, so you don’t need to install anything. GitHub will help with version control and collaborative coding. All class materials, exercises, and instructions will be available through our course repository.

# Active Learning & AI-Assisted Coding

# Learn Faster. Remember Longer.

- Hands-on learning boosts retention
- Read less, do more
- Build confidence, not frustration

::: {.notes}
Passive learning, like just reading or watching lectures, doesn’t lead to long-term retention. Instead, this course emphasizes active learning—solving coding problems, experimenting, and getting immediate feedback. This will help you learn faster and remember concepts much longer.
:::


# Learning by Doing

- Reading alone isn't enough
- Apply concepts through exercises
- Get instant feedback to reinforce learning

::: {.notes}
Cognitive research shows that reading alone has low retention rates. Instead of just absorbing information, you'll practice coding immediately after learning a concept. This hands-on approach will help you internalize Python effectively.
:::


# AI as Your Coding Assistant

- AI can help you generate and refine code
- Use AI for debugging and optimization
- AI-assisted learning boosts efficiency

::: {.notes}
In this course, you'll leverage AI to assist in writing, debugging, and improving your code. Learning to work with AI will help you enhance problem-solving skills, structure code better, and gain efficiency.

# Why Python?

- **Easy to learn** – Simple syntax, beginner-friendly
- **Powerful** – Used in data science, web dev, AI, etc.
- **Widely used** – Popular in industry and academia

::: {.notes}
Python is a fantastic first programming language. It’s widely used in various fields, from web development to artificial intelligence. This course will give you a strong foundation to build upon.
:::


# Python for Business Applications

- Automate repetitive tasks
- Process and analyze data
- Build AI-powered business tools

::: {.notes}
This course focuses on **real-world business applications** of Python, not just theory. You'll work on projects involving automation, data processing, and AI-driven solutions that align with business needs.
:::


# Course Projects & Expectations

- Hands-on projects from Day 1
- Build real-world Python applications
- Learn through practical problem-solving

::: {.notes}
Throughout the course, you'll be working on **real-world Python projects** to solidify your learning. This ensures you're not just memorizing concepts but applying them in meaningful ways.
:::

# Best Practices for Learning

- Use a **physical keyboard** (not mobile devices)
- Pay attention to **syntax and formatting**
- Follow industry standards for clean code

::: {.notes}
Coding on a physical keyboard helps build real-world programming skills. Attention to detail—like proper indentation and syntax—matters in Python and all programming languages. Learning these best practices early will help you in your coding journey.
:::

# Study, Practice, Rest

- Study a topic for 5-10 min
- Practice coding for 10-15 min
- Take breaks to absorb learning

::: {.notes}
Avoid long, exhausting study sessions. Instead, use short, focused study bursts followed by hands-on coding. This will make learning more efficient and enjoyable.
:::



# Get Ready to Code!

- Start coding from Day 1
- Ask questions, collaborate, and experiment
- Learning is a journey—enjoy it!

::: {.notes}
From the very first session, you’ll be writing code. Don’t hesitate to ask questions, work with your peers, and experiment. Learning programming is an exciting journey, and we’re here to support you every step of the way!
