    "# Debugging Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers are *very* literal, so literal that unless you're perfectly precise about what you want, they will end up doing something different. When that happens, one of the most difficult issues in programming is to understand *why* the code isn't doing what you expected. When the code doesn't do what we expect, it's called a bug.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bugs could be fundamental issues with the code you're using (in fact, the term originated because a moth causing a problem in an early computer) and, if you find one of these, you should file an issue with the maintainers of the code. However, what's much more likely is that the instructions you gave aren't quite what is needed to produce the outcome that you want. And, in this case, you might need to *debug* the code: to find out which part of it isn't doing what you expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with a small code base, it can be tricky to track down where the bug is: but don't fear, there are tools on hand to help you find where the bug is.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this course, [simple prints statement](debugging_print.ipynb) or using some fo the [builtin debugging features of Jupyter](debugging_jupyter.ipynb) will be sufficient.  But packages also exist such as [icecream](debugging_icecream.ipynb) and[rich](debugging_rich.ipynb) can also be used.\n"
