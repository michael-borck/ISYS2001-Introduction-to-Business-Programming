    "# Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you could take the group of instructions, then reuse them again and \n",
    "again. Well, this is what functions do! A function allows computer code \n",
    "(your instructions) to be packaged, named, and reused wherever you need it. \n",
    "A function encapsulates code and logic up altogether and assigns it a name.\n",
    "Then, all you have to do is call the function’s name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can be designed and programmed to do almost anything! However, \n",
    "they should be narrowly focused on a specific task. For example, they \n",
    "could be any one of these:\n",
    "* A print function, so that you can print your documents.\n",
    "* A route mapping function, so that you can get from your place to the closest \n",
    "* movie theater.\n",

    "## Functions as Black Box\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens when you wake up and press a button or two on your coffee machine?\n",
    "Coffee is brewed! But how did it work? Again, you really don't have a clue! \n",
    "You only know that it gives you that reviving liquid that you need every morning.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about a washing machine?  Or a car? You use these every day, but do you \n",
    "actually know how these machines make your clothes clean or get you from A to B? \n",
    "Systems like these are called black boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming a black box is a device, system, or object which can be viewed \n",
    "in terms of its inputs and outputs, without any knowledge of its internal \n",
    "workings. Black boxes are great, because you can ask them to perform a service \n",
    "without needing to understand the details behind how the service actually works!\n",
    "\n",
    "In python once a function has been developed and tested you and others can use \n",
    "the function like a black box.  Tha is we only worry about the inputs and the \n",
    "outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function can receive messages (data) through parameters.  Functions can send \n",
    "messages through return values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, through out the notebooks we make extensive use of print() function.\n",
    "We provide the inputs, string, numbers, list and expect the function to display \n",
    "the value of the *thing* provided.  We don't know how the functions does this, \n",
    "we just keep using the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Write your own functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides a mechanism to write your own functions.  Writing clean, simple\n",
    "functions is critical making sure they work well.  Good function take four basic \n",
    "steps:\n",
    "* choose a goal and name the function accordingly\n",
    "* define the end result\n",
    "* define the inputs\n",
    "* implement the logic\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Naming Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions have names.  That's part of what's so great about them: all you have \n",
    "do is call a function's name, and it'll be there. It's like a friend who \n",
    "appears right when you need them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since you call a function by its name, this name should be closely linked \n",
    "with what it does.  For example, if you had a function that automatically \n",
    "looked up contact information for friends, you could name it \"contact info,\" \n",
    "but that doesn't really tell you what it's doing.  It could be deleting contact \n",
    "information, publishing it, sending out letters - it all depends on how you \n",
    "interpret it.  Instead, if you name it \"Look up my friends' contact information\" \n",
    "you'd be much more aligned with what it actually does.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function Deceleration\n",
    "\n",
    "In python you can create a function using the *def* keyword. You can pass data \n",
    "into the functions, know as a parameter.  A function can return data as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try to understand this a little better.  We have a 6 (length) by 4 (width) \n",
    "rectangle and we want to print its perimeter. We can create a function which \n",
    "calculates it."
