    "Computers can’t actually think, but they can perform billions of logical operations per second. These logical operations are written by us and provide the computer with the instructions needed to perform the problem-solving.  This means you need to think like a computer and translate what you need it to do into program instructions it understands.\n",

    "Problem solving is process the helps people identify and solve problem sin their lives.  It is important to have a consistent approach to solving problems, a approach that is general enough to work for any problem.  The problem solving technique that we present here can be tailored to solve problems in other areas. However we assume that we are using a computer to help solve the problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of problem solving we will use can be broken down into 5 key steps:\n",
    "1. State the problem clearly\n",
    "2. Describe the input and output information\n",
    "3. Work the problem by hand\n",
    "4. Develop an algorithm (and convert to python) \n",
    "5. Test solution with a variety of data\n",
