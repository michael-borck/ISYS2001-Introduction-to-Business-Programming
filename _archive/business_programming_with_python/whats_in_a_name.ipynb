    "# What's in a name?\n",
    "\n",
    "The better named your variables, the clearer your code will be--and the fewer comments you will need to write! Use meaningful names for variables, functions, or whatever it is you're naming. Avoid abbreviations that you understand *now* but which will be unclear to others, or future you. For example, use `real_wage_hourly` over `re_wg_ph`. I know it's tempting to use `temp` but you'll feel silly later when you can't for the life of you remember what `temp` does or is. A good trick when naming booleans (variables that are either true or false) is to use `is` followed by what the boolean variable refers to, for example `is_married`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as this general tip, Python has conventions on naming different kinds of variables. The naming convention for almost all objects is lower case separated by underscores, e.g. `a_variable=10` or ‘this_is_a_script.py’. This style of naming is also known as snake case.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three exceptions to the snake case convention: classes, which should be in camel case, eg `ThisIsAClass`; constants, which are in capital snake case, eg `THIS_IS_A_CONSTANT`; and packages, which are typically without spaces or underscores and are lowercase `thisisapackage`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "- use descriptive variable names that reveal your intention, eg `days_since_treatment`\n",
    "- avoid using ambiguous abbreviations in names, eg use `real_wage_hourly` over `rw_ph`\n",
    "- always use the same vocabulary, eg don't switch from `worker_type` to `employee_type`\n",
    "- avoid 'magic numbers', eg numbers in your code that set a key parameter. Set these as named constants instead. Here's an example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "    import random\n",
    "\n",
    "    # This is bad\n",
    "    def roll():\n",
    "        return random.randint(0, 36)  # magic number!\n",
    "\n",
    "    # This is good\n",
    "    MAX_INT_VALUE = 36\n",
    "\n",
    "    def roll():\n",
    "        return random.randint(0, MAX_INT_VALUE)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- use verbs for function names, eg `get_regression`\n",
    "- use consistent verbs for function names, don't use `get_score` and `grab_results` (instead use `get` for both)\n",
    "- variable names should be snake_case and all lowercase, eg `first_name`\n",
    " - class names should be CamelCase, eg `MyClass`\n",
    "function names should be snake_case and all lowercase, eg `quick_sort()`\n",
    " - constants should be snake_case and all uppercase, eg `PI = 3.14159`\n",
    " - modules should have short, snake_case names and all lowercase, eg `pandas`\n",
    " - single quotes and double quotes are equivalent so pick one and be consistent—most automatic formatters prefer `\"`"
