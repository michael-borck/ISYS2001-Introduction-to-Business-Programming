    "# Principles of Clean Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing code is easy; writing clean code is hard! However, if you follow these principles, you won't go far wong.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Do not repeat yourself (DRY)\n",
    "\n",
    "The DRY principle is 'Every piece of knowledge or logic must have a single, unambiguous representation within a system.' Divide your code into re-usable pieces that you can call when and where you want. Don't write lengthy methods, but divide logic up into clearly differentiated chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This saves having to repeat code, having no idea whether it's this or that version of the same function doing the work, and will help your debugging efforts no end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some practical ways to apply DRY in practice are to use functions, to put functions or code that needs to be executed multiple times by multiple different scripts into another script (eg called `utilities.py`) and then import it, and to think carefully if another way of writing your code would be more concise (yet still readable).\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Tip\n",
    ":class: tip\n",
    "If you're using Visual Studio Code, you can [automatically send code into a function](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/refactoring) by right-clicking on code and using the 'Extract to method' option.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most systems work best if they are kept simple, rather than made complicated. This is a rule that says you should avoid unnecessary complexity. If your code is complex, it will only make it harder for you to understand what you did when you come back to it later.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SoC (Separation of Concerns) / Make it Modular\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not have a single file that does everything. If you split your code into separate, independent modules it will be easier to read, debug, test, and use. You can check the basics of coding chapter to see how to create and import functions from other scripts. But even within a script, you can still make your code modular by defining functions that have clear inputs and outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good rule of thumb is that if a code that achieves one end goes longer than about 30 lines, it should probably go into a function. Scripts longer than about 500 lines are ripe for splitting up too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relatedly, do not have a single function that tries to do everything. Functions should have limits too; they should do approximately one thing. If you're naming a function and you have to use 'and' in the name then it's probably worth splitting it into two functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions should have no 'side effects' either; that is, they shouldn't only take in value(s), and output value(s) via a return statement. They shouldn't modify global variables or make other changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another good rule of thumb is that each function shouldn't have lots of separate arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "A final tip for modularity and the creation of functions is that you shouldn't use 'flags' in functions (aka boolean conditions). Here's an example:"
