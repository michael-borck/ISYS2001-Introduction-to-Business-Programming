    "# Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is a web application where you can store Python code, results, graphics, formatted text There are other ways to work with Python, but in this unt we use a cloud computing environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is a [read-eval-print loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) (REPL) based system.  REPL is a simple interactive programming environment that executes commands and returns the results.  The program is executed piecewise.  In Jupyter the program *pieces* are contained in *cells* and a group of cells are called a *notebook*\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"notebook\" or \"notebook documents\" can contain both code and rich text elements, such as figures, links, and equations. Because of the mix of code and text elements, Jupyter Notebook is a great environment to analyse and annotate Python code allowing others to read and understand you program.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "When you first open Jupyter Notebook it will open a new page in your browser.  This is the Jupter Home page.  Lets create a Python 3 notebok. Start by clicking the *New* button (towards the upper right on the home page) and selecting *Python 3*.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will immediately see the notebook name, a menu bar, a toolbar and an empty code cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Different Cell Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Before Before diving into programming concepts, you should know the four cell types in a Jupyter Notebook: code, markdown, raw nbconvert, and heading.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code** -  the classic cell, like the first empty one you have when you create a notebook. This one is designed to write codes! You can execute your code by clicking the run button.\n",
    "- **Heading** - this one is deprecated. It was designed for titles, but you can now use markdown. It will probably disappear in the next versions of Jupyter.\n",
    "- **Raw nbconvert** - only intended for use with the nbconvert command line tool. Basically, it allows you to control the formatting in a very specific way when converting from a notebook to another format.\n",
    "**Markdown** - markup language that is a superset of HTML. It is designed to write your comments, titles, notes, etc. Click here to learn more about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You will primarily use the code and markdown cell types and in Google Colab these are the only cells types available. For both types, you simply write and run your text.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a text cell, you can apply some tags to style your text! For instance:\n",
    "- Titles: use the  #. One # will be a title 1, two # will be a title 2, etc.\n",
    "- Lists (bullet points): use the * notation in front of each item. Try the following text:\n",
    "- Bold: Usse \\*\\* with the <b> your text... </b> tag.\n",
    "And everything allowed with HTML!\n",
    "\n",
    "You now have a Python environment either Google Colab or Anaconda and know how to use a Jupyter Notebook. Let's do some Python programming.  Open the *Hello World* notebook and lets get programming!"

    "## Quick note about Jupyter cells\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are editing a cell in Jupyter notebook, you need to re-run the cell by pressing **`<Shift> + <Enter>`**. This will allow changes you made to be available to other cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use **`<Enter>`** to make new lines inside a cell you are editing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Re-running will execute any statements you have written. To edit an existing code cell, click on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Markdown cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Re-running will render the markdown text. To edit an existing markdown cell, double-click on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Jupyter operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Near the top of the Jupyter notebook window, there are a row of menu options (`File`, `Edit`, `View`, `Insert`, ...) and a row of tool bar icons (disk, plus sign, scissors, 2 files, clipboard and file, up arrow, ...).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inserting and removing cells\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the \"plus sign\" icon to insert a cell below the currently selected cell\n",
    "- Use \"Insert\" -> \"Insert Cell Above\" from the menu to insert above\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Clear the output of all cells\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use \"Kernel\" -> \"Restart\" from the menu to restart the kernel\n",
    "    - click on \"clear all outputs & restart\" to have all the output cleared\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Save your notebook file locally\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clear the output of all cells\n",
    "- Use \"File\" -> \"Download as\" -> \"IPython Notebook (.ipynb)\" to download a notebook file representing your https://mybinder.org session\n"

    "## Tips when using Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "*Version control* if you are using verion control, be wary of saving the outputs of Jupyter Notebooks when you only want to save code. Most IDEs that support Jupyter Notebooks have a clear outputs option. You can also automate this as a pre-commit git hook (if you don’t know what that is, don’t worry). You could also pair your notebook to a script or markdown file (covered in the next section). Outputs or not, Jupyter Notebooks will render on github.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Terminal commands* these can be run from inside a Jupyter Notebook by placing a ```!``` in front of the command and executing the cell. For example, ```!ls``` gives the directory the notebook is in. You can also ```!pip install``` and ```!conda install``` in this way. This works in Google Colab notebooks too.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Magic commands* statements that begin with % are magic commands. ```%whos``` displays information about defined variables. ```%run script.py``` runs a script called script.py. ```%timeit``` times how long the cell takes to execute. Finally, you can see many more magic commands using ```%quickref```.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook cells can be executed in any sequence you choose. But if you’re planning to share your notebook or use it again for yourself, it’s good practice to check that its cells do what you want when run in sequence, from top to bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are tons of extensions to Jupyter Notebooks. Of particular note is ipywidgets, which adds interactivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Get help info on a command by running it but with ? appended to end."
