    "There are different ways to write (and run) code that suit different needs. For example, for creating a reproducible pipeline of tasks or writing production-grade software, you might opt for a script——a file that is mostly code. But for sending instructions to a colleague or exploring a narrative, you might choose to write your code in a notebook because it can present text and code together more naturally than a script can.\n",

    "Let’s now turn to all of the different ways you can write code in a fully-featured integrated development environment like Visual Studio Code. They each have pros and cons, and you’re likely to want to use them at different times. The table below sets out all of the different ways you can write, and execute, code\n",

    "| What | How to use  | Prerequisites | Pros | Cons\n",
    "|------|----------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n",
    "| Script, eg `script.py`   |   1. Run `python script.py` on the command line; or 2. 'Run in interactive window' in an integrated development environment (IDE)         | 1. Python installation,  2. Python installation + an IDE with Python support, eg Visual Studio Code. | Can be run all-in-one or step-by-step as needed. Very powerful tools available to aid coding in scripts. De facto standard for production-quality code. Can be imported by other scripts. Version control friendly. | Not very good if you want to have lots of text alongside code.\n",
    "| Jupyter Notebook, eg `notebook.ipynb`   | 1.  In the same folder as the file, run `jupyter lab` on the command line, which will open a browser window, then follow the options to open the relevant file; or 2. Open the file with Visual Studio Code.     |    1. Python installation with jupyter lab installed (install by running `pip install jupyterlab` on the command line), 2. Everything in 1 + Visual Studio Code and the VS Code Jupyter extension.  | Code and text can alternate in the same document. Rich outputs of code can be integrated into document. Can export to PDF, HTML, and more, with control over whether code inputs/outputs are shown. Can be run all-in-one or step-by-step as needed. | Fussy to use with version control. Code and text cannot be mixed in same 'cell'. Not easy to import in other code files.\n",
    "| Markdown with executable code chunks, eg `markdown_script.md`   | To produce markdown output, use `codebraid pandoc --from markdown --to markdown markdown_script.md` on the command line. Other output types available. | Installations of Python, codebraid (a Python package), and pandoc (an application). | Allows for true mixing of text and code. Can export to wide variety of other formats, such as PDF and HTML, with control over whether code inputs/outputs are shown. Version control friendly. | Must be run all-in-one so cannot see outputs of individual code-chunks as you go. Cannot be imported by other code files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the options above make use of the command line, a way to issue text-based instructions to your computer. Remember, the command line (aka the terminal) can be accessed via the Terminal app on Mac, the Command Prompt app on Windows, or <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>t</kbd> on Linux. To open up the command line within Visual Studio Code, you can use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>⌃</kbd> + <kbd>\\`</kbd> (on Mac) or \n",
    "<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>\\`</kbd> (Windows/Linux), or click \"View > Terminal\".\n",

    "Scripts and notebooks are by far the most popular ways to write code.  The typical workflow in this course recommends working with notebooks.
