    "Consider how people utilise computers and then write down your thoughts. Students utilise computers at school to compose papers, research articles, send emails, and take online classes. At work, people conduct business, communicate with customers, and operate machines. Computers are used for these and many more tasks. People use computers at home to pay bills, purchase online, communicate with loved ones, and play games. Remember that phones, tablets, GPS systems, and many other devices are computers.\n",

    "Many of the following concepts will help you understand why a programming break the complex problems down into many small steps.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's because computers can be programmed that they can do so many different things. This means that computers aren't built to do just one thing, but to do any job that their programmes tell them to do, which means they can do anything. A programme is a set of instructions that a computer can follow to do something.\n",

    "This course will teach you the basics of computer programming with the Python programming language. Before we can talk about those ideas, you need to know a few things about computers and how they work. This chapter gives you a solid base of knowledge. First, we talk about the physical parts that most computers are made of. In the next part, we look at how computers store and run programmes.\n",

    "## Hardware and Software\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "The physical devices that a computer is made of are referred to as the computer’s hardware. The programs that run on a computer are referred to as software.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Hardware\n",
    "\n",
    "A computer is a collection of interconnected components. A computer's hardware includes all of its physical components. You've probably seen commercials for computer parts like microprocessors, memory, and disc drives. Components are the parts. These areas require extensive computing knowledge to comprehend. It's difficult to understand what these sections do unless you know a lot about computers. a typical computer system consists of the following major components:\n",
    "* The central processing unit (CPU) - this is the part that actually runs the program.\n",
    "* Main memory - this is where the computer stores the running program and the data.  This is commonly know a random-access memory or RAM.\n",
    "* Secondary storage devices - Special type of memory that can store programs and data even when there is no power to the computer.\n",
    "* Input devices - collects data and sends it to the computer.  Example keyboard, mouse, camera etc\n",
    "* Output devices - data is sent ot an output device.  Example are monitors or printers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Software\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs are commonly referred to as software. Software is essential to a computer because without software, a computer can do nothing.  There are two general categories of software: \n",
    "* System software. Manage the basic operations of the computer hardware\n",
    "  * Operating systems - fundamental set of programs to control the internal operations ofthe computers hardware and manages all connected devices.\n",
    "  * Utility Programs - program to perform a specialised task.  Example virus scanners, file compressions\n",
    "  * Software Development - tools used by the programmer to create, modify and test software.\n",
    "* Application software - these are program that make the computer useful for everyday taks.  Examples include spreadsheet programs, email programs, web browsers etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How computers store data\n",
    "\n",
    "A computers memory is divided into tiny storage locations know as bytes.  each byte is divided into eight smaller storage locations known a bits. The bit can indicate one of two values depending on whether it is turned on or off. A bit that is turned off in a computer system represents the number 0 while a bit that is turned on represents the number 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Storing Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "A bit can only be used to represent numbers in a very limited fashion. the binary numbering system. In the binary numbering system (or binary, as it is usually called), all numeric values are written as sequences of 0s and 1s. Here is an example of the number 157 that is written in binary:\n",
    "\n",
    "      100111101\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers are able to store negative numbers and real numbers in memory, but to do so they use encoding schemes along with the binary numbering system. You don’t need to know how these encoding schemes work, only that they are used to convert negative numbers and real numbers to binary format.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Storing Characters\n",
    "\n",
    "Any piece of data that is stored in a computer's memory must be stored as a binary digit. When a character is to be stored into memory it need to be converted into a binary digit.  You don’t need to know how these encoding schemes work, only that they internation standards used to convert binary digits to and from characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other types of data\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers are digital devices.  The term digital mean it uses binary numbers. Digital pictures are composed of picture elements know as pixels.  The numeric code is stored in memory as a binary number.  The encoding scheme could the jpeg or some other picture format.  A digital song is broken into the smaller pieces know as samples.  the more samples a song is divided into the more it sounds like the original music.\n"
