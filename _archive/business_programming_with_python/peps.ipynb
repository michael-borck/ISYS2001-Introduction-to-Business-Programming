    "[Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) was the benevolent dictator for life ([BDFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life)) of Python. He [stepped down in July of 2018](https://www.mail-archive.com/python-committers@python.org/msg05628.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "Until that time, to get new features or other enhancements into the language, Guido either wrote or (usually) considered a **[Python Enhancement Proposal](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/)**, or a **PEP**.  Each PEP is carefully reviewed, and often there are many iterations with the PEP's author(s). Ultimately, Guido decided if the PEP becomes part of the Python language. Now, that decision is made by the [Python Steering Council](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8016/), which consists of five members."
