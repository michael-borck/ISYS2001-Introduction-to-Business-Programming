    "# Use relative filepaths\n",
    "\n",
    "A path, or filepath, is a slash-separated list of directory names followed by either a directory name or a file name. You'll use them to read data into code, for example using `df = pd.read_csv('path/to/data.csv')`. A directory is the same as a folder. On Unix based systems (Mac and Linux), these paths use forward slashes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "/Users/yourname/Documents/projects/file.csv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "On Windows, which insists on being different, the slashes go the other way:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "C:\\Documents\\projects\\file.csv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These are *absolute paths*, that is they give the full information to go from a disk to the file. These are okay on your computer, but they are useless for replicability or for working with co-authors. It's much better in that case to use *relative paths*, where the path to a file is defined relative to a project folder. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "project_folder/data/raw/file.csv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we use the convention that code executed for a project should have the project folder as its root directory, and any paths are relative to it. So to open `file.csv` using **pandas**, you would use\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv('data/raw/file.csv')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This works great on Mac and Linux, but it's not going to work on Windows; Windows uses backwards slashes, which unfortunately tend to do other things in programming too. To ensure relative paths work across operating systems, the best way is to wrap the file path in a call to the `Path` method in the **pathlib** module:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pathlib import Path\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "path_to_data = Path('data/raw/file.csv')\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv(path_to_data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**pathlib** will translate the relative path you have entered into whatever the local operating system needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting up Visual Studio Code so that Python interactive windows and terminals start in the current folder, typically your project's root directory, makes it easier to use relative filepaths.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Start interactive windows and terminals within your project directory\n",
    "In Visual Studio Code, you can ensure that the interactive window starts in the root directory of your project by setting \"Jupyter: Notebook File Root\" to `${workspaceFolder}` in the Settings menu. For the integrated command line, change \"Terminal › Integrated: Cwd\" to `${workspaceFolder}` too.\n",
