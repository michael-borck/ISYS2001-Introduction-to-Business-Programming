    "# Whats Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a general-purpose programming language conceived in 1989 by Dutch programmer [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is free and open source, with development coordinated through the Python Software Foundation. Python has experienced rapid adoption in the last decade and is now one of the most popular programming languages. See [Python Enhancement Proposal](03_peps.ipynb) to understand the core of Python development principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "A general-purpose language, which means it can be used to build just \n",
    "about anything! Professionally, Python is great for backend web development, \n",
    "data analysis, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing. Many \n",
    "developers have also used Python to build productivity tools, games, and \n",
    "desktop apps. For instance:\n",
    "* Instagram is built in Python.\n",
    "* It is one of the three official languages used by Google engineers.\n",
    "* Netflix uses Python to power its data analysis on the server side.\n",
    "* Dropbox uses Python for its desktop client.\n",
    "* Reddit is coded in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many general purpose programming languages.  Why did we choose Python for this course?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python is beginner friendly and often used to teach programming\n",
    "* Python is [replacing familiar tools like Excel](https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/2019/11/python-replaced-excel-banking) in finance and banking\n",
    "* Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).\n",
    "* Python has a simple elegant syntax similar to the English language.\n",
    "* Python runs on an [interpreter system](03_programming_languages.ipynb), meaning that code can be executed as\n",
    "  soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.\n",
    "* Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.\n",
    "* Python is an elegant design.  Not as noticeable when first starting out, but the \n",
    "  implementation of features like iterators, generators, decorators, namespaces \n",
    "  and list comphrensiona make Python very expressive.  You can get more done with less code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Syntax compared to other programming languages\n",
    "* Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English \n",
    "  language with influence from mathematics.\n",
    "* Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming \n",
    "  languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.\n",
    "* Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the \n",
    "  scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often \n",
    "  use curly-brackets for this purpose.\n"
