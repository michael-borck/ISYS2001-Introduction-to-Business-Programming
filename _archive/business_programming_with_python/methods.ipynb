    "You already know a little about functions, which are blocks of code with a name \n",
    "that you can reuse. That block of code is a set of instructions you want a \n",
    "program to perform.  But what are methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods are functions that are defined inside a class. You can, however, \n",
    "isolate instance methods, that are executed within the context of an object \n",
    "from class methods, which operate directly on the class.\n",

    "That sounds a bit abstract, but you have already been using them! Let's \n",

    "## String methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has quite a few methods that string objects can call to perform \n",
    "frequently occurring tasks related to strings. For example, you may need to \n",
    "put your string in capital letters, or maybe just the first character, or \n",
    "replace a specific character.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the corresponding methods:\n",
    "* upper: returns an uppercase string.\n",
    "* lower: returns a lowercase string.\n",
    "* capitalize: capitalizes the first letter. \n",
    "* count: returns occurrences of substring in string.\n",
    "* replace: replaces a character or a substring inside your string.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the notebook on strings for examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Collection methods\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of list or dict methods you already know. For example,  \n",
    "append,  insert , and remove are the most commonly used. Here are some others:\n",
    "* sort : sorts the list (from min to max with numerics, alphabetical order \n",
    "  with strings). You can't sort a list of mixed data types.\n",
    "* pop : removes the element at the specified position, and displays it for \n",
    "  the list. It also removes the element with the specified key and displays\n",
    "  it for the dict.\n",
    "* values : returns a list of all the values in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the notebooks on list, dict. tuple for examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Methods of a class are functions that operate in the context of that class.\n",
    "* To call methods, a dot notation is commonly used: variableName.methodName() \n",
    "  or lassName.methodName().\n",
    "* Some methods change the original object, while others return a new object \n",
    "  with the result of the method applied."
