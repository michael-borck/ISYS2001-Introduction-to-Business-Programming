    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Are you interested in computer programming but are not sure where to start? \n",
    "Are you a little unsure of the terminology, intimidated by the abstract \n",
    "concepts, or even overwhelmed by the all the available programming languages?\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is designed to demystify the logic used in computer programming and \n",
    "give you the confidence you need to take your first steps towards a career in \n",
    "programming. By using concrete, everyday examples, you'll be able to focus on \n",
    "learning the most frequently used concepts without getting lost in a sea of \n",
    "jargon. You'll discover that coding isn't as complex as people make it out to \n",
    "be, and that anyone can learn it - including you! \n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "The course aims to give you the skills you need to code for business, while also giving you bits and pieces of information about programming more generally that might be useful to you. It’s suitable for complete beginners who have never written any code before. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have made choices regarding what to include, what to omit, and what to recommend. We have given recommendations based on what will serve you best in the long-run. Very occasionally, you will wonder why such and such a thing is useful for coding in an business context.  But, hopefully by the end you will realise that you weren't learning to code you were becoming a programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Familiarity with Python is not necessary. Those that already have some experience with Python, however, may find the tutorials from this course (too) easy. To challenge those people, we included several more difficult (optional) sections and exercises in the tutorials!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Teaching philosophy\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe in learning by doing. We teach almost everything through real examples. As we go through the examples, you'll be gradually learning any theoretical foundations needed.  The goal is that you'll see why it matters and how to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of your time will be spent by working on exercises, which we call ToDos. Although these exercises are ungraded, we highly recommend that you try to do them. If you manage to work through all of them, getting a decent grade on this course is expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll look into how computers solve problems with apply simple operations on data.\n",
    "Then we will look at way of combining these simple operations into functions.\n",
    "From there, we'll check out how computer \n",
    "programs store all the information you give them.  We will briefly look at how to combine data and operations in object.  Finally look at how to combine functions and object into modules and packages so we can deploy our programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concepts and mechanics of coding we will introduce in the course are the same for many of the most popular programming  languages today, including Java, Python, Ruby, Swift, C++, C#, Kotlin, PHP, Go, \n",
    "Javascript, and many more. That means that regardless of the language you first learn, you'll be able to learn other languages faster.  Ready to dive into computer programming? In this course, and \n",
    "we'll have you thinking like a computer in no time!\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is coding?\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer programming, or coding, is the process of issuing a series of commands that a computer can understand and execute in order to perform a task. Today, almost all research with some quantitative aspect involves coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a computer as being like a particularly mischievous genie; if your instructions aren't completely unambiguous, the computer won't do what you asked for. So we write out our code, our list of instructions for the computer, very explicitly to make sure *we* can check we wrote what we meant, and that the computer will do it in the way we anticipate. Like a genie though, if you can get the instructions just so, you can create magical things.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why should you learn to code?\n",
    "\n",
    "So much of business is quantitative.  Using spreadsheets, writing macros, analysing trends, coding is an essential skill for many in business. Many of the tools and packages that have been developed will help you to do better work more productively. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a skill, programming is enormously valuable *beyond business* too because it's used across a wide range of domains (this is especially true for general purpose programming languages). Code is widely used across industry, academia, and the public sector in everything from computer games to websites, data science to software applications. And learning basic programming concepts in any language is useful for almost any other programming language. So learning to code is good for your human capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coding is like a superpower; it's both fun and powerful! \n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading guide\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read this book in any order depending on your experience. Check the section headings and numbered chapter headings to find out what would be most valuable for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using the book interactively\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as reading the book, you can also run the code examples for yourself (this is a great way to learn). There are two ways to run code from the book:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All pages that have code on can be downloaded to your desktop and run as *Jupyter Notebooks*. Click the download symbol in the top right hand corner of the page and select '.ipynb', which stands for 'ipython notebook'. You will need to install software on your computer to run Jupyter Notebooks. This book recommends the Anaconda distribution of Python, which provides an installation of the Python language for your computer. To write and run code and notebooks, this book recommends [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial) (plus its Python extension). There's more on how to get started with Anaconda Python and Visual Studio Code together in the next chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Most pages that have code on can be run as a *Google Colab* notebook with a single click on `Colab`, found under the rocket button at the top of the page. If you need to install any extra packages in a Google Colab session, the syntax is `!pip install packagename` to install a library called 'packagename'. Colab notebooks are run in a browser window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if you're on a secure network, you may find that options 2 and 3 don't work for you. However, as long as you can download and run files locally, option 1 should always work.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a small number of the examples using data, you may need to download the relevant files from this book's github [repository](https://github.com/michael-borck/business_programming_with_python), but this will always be explained in the relevant subsections.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Tip\n",
    ":class: tip\n",
    "Every page with code can be downloaded and run as a Jupyter notebook--just click <i class=\"fas fa-download\"></i> at the top of the page and select '.ipynb'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most pages with code can be run in Google Colab --just click <i class=\"fas fa-rocket\"></i> at the top of the page and select 'Colab'.\n",
