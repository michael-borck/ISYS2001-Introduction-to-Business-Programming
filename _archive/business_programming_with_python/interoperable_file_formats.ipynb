    "# Interoperable file formats\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll talk much more about data in the case studies, tutorials and lectures. For now, some basic pointers for the most common form of data: tabular data that's arranged in columns and rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "First: **do not** store your data in Excel file formats. Ever. First, it's not an open format, it's proprietary, even if you can open it with many open source tools. Second, more importantly, Excel can do bad things like [changing the underlying values in your dataset](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2014/11/excel-spreadsheets-are-hard-to-get-right/) (dates and booleans), and it tempts other users to start slotting Excel code around the data. This is bad - best practice is to **separate** code and data. Code hidden in Excel cells is not very transparent or auditable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not use proprietary file formats of software to store data long term. Often the the format changes with the version of the software and you not want your data to depend on what version of software you're using! Most proprietary binary formats are not very interoperable across tools and many are not very efficient in the way that they use disk space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although open source and compressed, I also don't recommend the statistical language R's RDS format or Python's pickle format, because neither are easily accessible from other tools. These are okay for intermediate data within a project that won't persist, but you could also use parquet for that, which is cross-platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "## CSV\n",
    "\n",
    "In the majority of cases, the best data file format for your project is CSV--certainly for outputting final results. Everyone can open a CSV file, no matter what analytical tool or operating system they are using. As a storage format, it’s unlikely to change. Without going into the mire of [different encodings](http://kunststube.net/encoding/), save it with the UTF-8 encoding (note that this is not the default encoding in Windows).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parquet\n",
    "\n",
    "Although beyond the scope of this course, if you're working with big data, I *strongly* recommend the parquet file format. In most programming languages, it's [blazing fast](https://ursalabs.org/blog/2019-10-columnar-perf/) for input/output and packs down to a **very efficient size**. For example, a file saved in parquet might be 10 times smaller than the same .dta file; in tests, a 114 Mb parquet file was a whopping 4.68 GB in R's RDS format. If you're using cloud or have a small laptop, these space-savings add up. Better yet, parquet is available across a wide range of tools and languages including Python, R, Ruby, C++, Java, and Go. Worth saying that parquet won't always be the right choice, but it's a great default for big data.\n"
