    "## Advanced Coding Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "If you are just learning to code you should feel free to skip this section for now.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other coding tips that are useful but that make use of concepts \n",
    "or tools that we haven't met yet. To be comprehensive, they are included here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Version Control\n",
    "\n",
    " - Control versions of your code using Git, which is the standard for research, industry, and everyone on planet Earth.\n",
    " - Code should be committed regularly, preferably when a discrete unit of work has been completed.\n",
    " - Continuous integration, for example using tools such as GitHub Actions, should be used to ensure that each change is integrated into the workflow smoothly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    " - Credentials and other secrets are not written in code but are configured as environment variables.\n",
    " - Configuration as applied to code or simulations is written as code, but is clearly separated from code used for analysis.\n",
    " - The configuration used to generate particular outputs, releases and publications is recorded.\n",
    " - If appropriate, multiple configuration files are used and interchangeable depending on system/local/user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environments\n",
    "- Code environments are reproducible and development is done within a consistent code environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project management\n",
    "\n",
    "- The roles and responsibilities of team members are clearly defined.\n",
    "- An issue tracker (e.g GitHub Project, Trello, or Jira) is used to record development tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Core functionality is unit tested as code.\n",
    "- Code based tests are run regularly and before each commit (for example using pre-commit).\n",
    "- Bug fixes include implementing new unit tests to ensure that the same bug does not reoccur.\n",
    "- Tests are automatically run and recorded using continuous integration.\n",
    "- The whole process is tested from start to finish using one or more realistic end-to-end tests.\n",
    "- Test code is clean an readable.\n",
