    "## Logging\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging is a means of tracking events that happen when software runs. An event is described by a descriptive message that can optionally contain data about variables that are defined as the code is executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging has two main purposes: to record events of interest, such as an error, and to act as an auditable account of what happened after the fact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a built-in logger.  But if interested see [**loguru**](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru), a package that makes logging a little easier and has some nice settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "We wont be looking at logging in this course, it is included here for completeness."
