    "# What is a variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It help to read the notebook on Values.  Computers do two things really well. \n",
    "***Store values*** and ***perform operations*** on those values. Programs do \n",
    "something with data.  Data is stuff that you put into your program.  \n",
    "We use variables to store, manipulate and process the data.  A variable is a \n",
    "container.  You can think of a variable as a box that contains a value.  \n",
    "This box is stored on a shelf within a gigantic warehouse.  In this analogy, \n",
    "the warehouse is the computers memory (or RAM).  \n",
    "\n",
    "A **value** is a piece od data we put into a variable.  Keeping with our warehouse analogy, different boxes and store different thing.  Similarly, different variable can store different values. As in the ware house you can change the content of boxes we can do similar things to variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The location of every box is carefully recorded.  In a computer this location is a memory address.  Memory address are hard for human to remember and use, so we give our variable a unique name.  We call this name an identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Naming variables\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Naming rules\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable names must be unique and they are case sensitive.\n",
    "* Only letters, numbers, and the underscore character (_) can be used  ```this.is.not.allowed```\n",
    "* No spaces ```this is not allowed```\n",
    "* No quotes ```“NotAllowed”```\n",
    "* Can’t start with a number ```6notAllowed```\n",
    "* Can't be a keyword  ```import```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Naming conventions\n",
    "We will learn other naming conventions, but for now\n",
    "* variable names should be meaningful (can someone else understand)\n",
    "* separate words with underscores ```monthly_sales```  (this is called snake_case)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a variable\n",
    "\n",
    "You must create a variable in code if you are going to use one. Python is a  object-oriented language, meaning that every variable is an object.  We discuss object oriented programming later in the semester. \n",
    "\n",
    "Variables need a name and contain a value.  Rather than declaring the type of value a variable can store (need to know how much memory space to reserve), in Python they are declared automatically when you assign a value to a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of variables in Python. Variables containing numbers can be declared by writing the name of a variable and its initial value."
