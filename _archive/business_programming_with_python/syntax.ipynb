    "Coding languages are not much different than spoken/written languages. There are \n",
    "rules for written languages: Punctuation (e.g. periods, commas, etc.) carries \n",
    "meaning. For example, a period indicates the end of a complete thought. Complete \n",
    "sentences must follow a basic structure. At a minimum, they must contain a \n",
    "noun (who/what) and a verb (action). Spelling is important. There is one \n",
    "(but sometimes multiple) acceptable spelling for a word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, Python follows a few different rules.  Here is a overview to refer \n",
    "back to as you learn the language\n",
    "\n",
    "* New lines are used to separate logical statements (similar to a period at the \n",
    "  end of a sentence).\n",
    "* Whitespaces (spaces and tabs) are used to indicate which statements \n",
    "  should be grouped together (called blocks) and colons (:) are used to indicate \n",
    "  the continuation of an idea at a deeper level.\n",
    "* Statements are evaluated from top to bottom, left to right, and in parenthesis\n",
    "  from the inside out.\n",
    "* Python is case sensitive\n",
    "* Set of reserved words, called keywords, that cannot be use for variables \n",
    "  names, functions names or any other identifies\n",

    "## Code in Style\n",
    "\n",
    "Most programming languages have a style guide, or at least some conventions! \n",
    "['PEP8'](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) is not the only Python style guide around: another popular one is \n",
    "the [Google style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html). \n",
    "But ['PEP8'](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) is the most popular and the style guide used in this course.\n",
