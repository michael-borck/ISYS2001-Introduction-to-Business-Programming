    "We been writing simple program across the various notebooks. We have been using \n",
    "variable to store out data within the program. And at time prompting the user \n",
    "for input.\n",

    "A text file is a file that can be opened in a text editor and is human readable.  \n",
    "Examples include:\n",
    "* Plain text\n",

    "## Python file IO\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has several functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key function for working with files in Python is the *open()* function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The open() function takes two parameters; filename, and mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four different methods (modes) for opening a file:\n",
    "* \"r\" - Read - Default value. Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist\n",
    "* \"a\" - Append - Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist\n",
    "* \"w\" - Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist\n",
    "* \"x\" - Create - Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition you can specify if the file should be handled as binary or text mode\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"t\" - Text - Default value. Text mode\n",
    "* \"b\" - Binary - Binary mode (e.g. images)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example\n",
    "\n",
    "    f = open(\"myfile.txt\", \"rt\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Because \"r\" for read, and \"t\" for text are the default values, you do not need to specify them\n",
    "\n",
    "    f = open(\"myfile.txt\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Write to a file\n",
    "Three steps\n",
    "1. Open the file in appropriate mode. To open a file in Python, use the open() \n",
    "   method, with one of the following parameters:\n",
    "      * \"x\" - Create - will create a file, returns an error if the file exist\n",
    "      * \"a\" - Append - will create a file if the specified file does not exist otherwise append to end of file\n",
    "      * \"w\" - Write - will create a file if the specified file does not exist, otherwise overwrite any existing content\n",
    "2. Write data to the file.  To write to a file, once it is open use the write() method\n",
    "3. close the file To close a file, use the close() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The open() function will return a file handle.  we use the files handle for all processing."
