# AI-First Python: Build real-world business projects with AI-assisted learning!

- Learn Python efficiently and effectively
- Build long-term programming skills
- Engage in hands-on coding
- Make learning fun and interactive

::: {.notes}
Welcome to the course! This isn't just about reading and listening to lectures; it's about actively engaging with Python through coding exercises. By following this approach, you’ll not only learn Python quickly but also retain what you learn for the long term.
:::

# Why Python?!

- **Easy to learn** – Simple syntax, beginner-friendly
- **Powerful** – Used in data science, web dev, AI, etc.
- **Widely used** – Popular in industry and academia

::: {.notes}
Python is a fantastic first programming language. It’s widely used in various fields, from web development to artificial intelligence. This course will give you a strong foundation to build upon.
:::

# Python for Business Applications

- Automate repetitive tasks (e.g., sending emails to customers)
- Process and analyse data
- Build AI-powered business tools

::: {.notes}
This course focuses on **real-world business applications** of Python, not just theory. You'll work on projects involving automation, data processing, and AI-driven solutions that align with business needs.
:::

# Course Projects & Expectations

- Hands-on projects from Day 1
- Build real-world Python applications (e.g., a program to analyse sales data)
- Learn through practical problem-solving

::: {.notes}
Throughout the course, you'll be working on **real-world Python projects** to solidify your learning. This ensures you're not just memorising concepts but applying them in meaningful ways.
:::

# A Flipped Classroom Approach!

- Watch short tutorials before class
- Code during class with guidance
- Collaborate with peers
- Immediate feedback for better learning

::: {.notes}
We’re using a flipped classroom model. This means you'll watch short tutorials and read materials before class. Then, in class, you'll apply what you've learned through exercises, discussions, and coding challenges, with the instructor and peers available to help.
:::

# Tools You'll Use

- **Google Colab** – Cloud-based Python coding
- **GitHub** – Version control & collaboration (track changes, work together)
- **Class Resources** – Guides, videos, and exercises

::: {.notes}
We’ll use Google Colab for coding, so you don’t need to install anything. GitHub will help with version control and collaborative coding. All class materials, exercises, and instructions will be available through our course repository.
:::

# Active Learning for Lasting Results

- Hands-on learning boosts retention
- Read less, do more
- Build confidence, not frustration

::: {.notes}
Passive learning, like just reading or watching lectures, doesn’t lead to long-term retention. Instead, this course emphasises active learning—solving coding problems, experimenting, and getting immediate feedback. This will help you learn faster and remember concepts much longer. Cognitive research shows that reading alone has low retention rates. Instead of just absorbing information, you'll practise coding immediately after learning a concept. This hands-on approach will help you internalise Python effectively.
:::

# AI as Your Coding Assistant

- AI can help you generate and refine code (e.g., suggest better ways to write your code)
- Use AI for debugging and optimisation (e.g., help you find and fix errors)
- AI-assisted learning boosts efficiency

::: {.notes}
In this course, you'll leverage AI to assist in writing, debugging, and improving your code. Learning to work with AI will help you enhance problem-solving skills, structure code better, and gain efficiency.
:::

# Best Practices for Learning

- Use a **physical keyboard** (not mobile devices)
- Pay attention to **syntax and formatting** (e.g., proper indentation makes your code easier to read)
- Follow industry standards for clean code

::: {.notes}
Coding on a physical keyboard helps build real-world programming skills. Attention to detail—like proper indentation and syntax—matters in Python and all programming languages. Learning these best practices early will help you in your coding journey.
:::

# Study, Practice, Rest!

- Study a topic for 5-10 min
- Practise coding for 10-15 min
- Take breaks to absorb learning

::: {.notes}
Avoid long, exhausting study sessions. Instead, use short, focused study bursts followed by hands-on coding. This will make learning more efficient and enjoyable.
:::

# Let's Get Started!

- Start coding from Day 1
- Ask questions, collaborate, and experiment
- Learning is a journey—enjoy it!

::: {.notes}
From the very first session, you’ll be writing code. Don’t hesitate to ask questions, work with your peers, and experiment. Learning programming is an exciting journey, and we’re here to support you every step of the way!
