Welcome to your first coding experience with Google Colab! We'll go through several steps to set up your environment, write some code, and save your work to GitHub.

## Step 1: Log into Google

1. Open your web browser and go to google.com
2. Click the "Sign In" button in the top-right corner.
3. Enter your Google account email and password.
4. If you don't have a Google account, click "Create account" and follow the prompts.

## Step 2: Access Google Colab

1. Once logged in, go to colab.research.google.com
2. Click on "New Notebook" to create a new Colab notebook.

## Step 3: Rename Your Notebook

1. Look at the top-left corner of your Colab window. You'll see the current name of your notebook (probably "Untitled0.ipynb" or similar).
2. Click on this name.
3. A text box will appear. Type in a meaningful name for your notebook, like "My_First_Python_Program".
4. Press Enter to save the new name.

## Step 4: Write Your First Code

In the first code cell, type the following:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Run the cell by clicking the play button or pressing Shift+Enter.

You should see the output "Hello, World!" printed below the cell.

Congratulations! You've just written and executed your first Python program.

## Step 3: Set Up GitHub

1. If you don't have a GitHub account, go to github.com and sign up.
2. Log in to your GitHub account.
3. Click the '+' icon in the top-right corner and select 'New repository'.
4. Name your repository (e.g., "python-learning").
5. Set the repository to Private (this is a unit requirement to prevent plagiarism).
6. Click "Create repository".

## Step 4: Link Colab to GitHub

1. In Colab, click on the gear icon in the top-right to open Settings.
2. Go to the "GitHub" tab.
3. Click on "Allow access to private repositories".
4. Follow the prompts to authorize Colab to access your GitHub account.

## Step 5: Save to GitHub

1. In Colab, click "File" > "Save a copy in GitHub".
2. Select your newly created repository.
3. Add a commit message (e.g., "First Python program").
4. Make sure "Include a link to Colaboratory" is checked.
5. Click "OK" to save.

## Step 6: Follow-up Exercises

1. Modify the string to print "Hello, Weather!"

2. Print the single character 'E'

3. Change the code to print "Hello Alex!" (Replace Alex with your name)

4. Try leaving off a quote character. What happens? Was the error message helpful? Did it give any clues about what went wrong?

Remember to save your changes to GitHub after completing the exercises!

Good luck, and have fun with your first coding experience!
