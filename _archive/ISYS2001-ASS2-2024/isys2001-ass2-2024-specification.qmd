## Overview

In this assignment, you will utilise the [Simulacra python package](https://github.com/teaching-repositories/simulacra) to conduct
simulations across various business scenarios. You will select a simulation
type, set parameters to model realistic situations, visualise outcomes, analyse
the effects of parameter changes, and extract insights to support
decision-making processes. Your work will be compiled in a Google Colab Notebook
and saved to a dedicated GitHub repository.

## Objectives

- Understand and apply simulation techniques in business contexts.
- Analyse the impact of different variables in simulation models.
- Develop skills in data visualisation and interpretation.

## Assignment Tasks

#### 1. Setup:
   - Create a new **PRIVATE** GitHub repository specifically for this assignment.
   - Clone the repository in your Google Colab environment to ensure all changes
     are version-controlled.
   - Install the Simulacra package from our class GitHub repository. Follow the
     provided setup instructions to prepare your environment for running
     simulations.

#### 2. Choose Your Simulation:
   - Decide which simulation you want to explore, Choose **one** simulation:
     - Stock Market Simulation
     - Resource Fluctuations Simulation
     - Product Popularity Simulation

#### 3. Familiarise Yourself with the Simulation:
   - Read the detailed documentation for your selected simulation type within
     the Simulacra package. Run the related [starter notebook](https://github.com/teaching-repositories/simulacra-starters/tree/main) Understand the role and typical range of each
     parameter.

#### 4. Execute the Simulation:
   - Instantiate your chosen simulation class with initial parameters reflecting
     a realistic scenario.
   - Execute the simulation by calling the `run_simulation()` method and collect
     the output data.

#### 5. Visualise the Simulation Data:
   - Use various plotting techniques (e.g., line plots, bar charts) to visualise
     key trends and dynamics within the data.
   - Highlight any significant effects due to specific events or interventions,
     if relevant.

#### 6. Analytical Experimentation:
   - Modify parameters to explore how changes influence simulation outcomes.
   - Analyse key metrics derived from the data (like peak values, averages,
     variability).
   - Model potential strategies or interventions and assess their impact.

#### 7. Compile and Report Your Findings:
   - Assemble your work into a Jupyter Notebook that includes:
     - Code implementations along with detailed comments.
     - Visualisations with captions explaining each figure.
     - A comprehensive analysis section discussing parameter choices, observed
       results, and their implications.
     - A reflection on the simulation's limitations and suggestions for improvement.
   - Commit regularly to your GitHub repository to maintain a log of your
     progress.
   - Submit a zip of your GitHub repository to capture all logs for analysis of
     your commit frequency and development progress.

## Starter Notebooks

Here is the [Simulacra starter notebooks GitHub repository](https://github.com/teaching-repositories/simulacra-starters/tree/main).  You have three possible starter notebooks to choose from: the [Product Popularity Simulator](https://github.com/teaching-repositories/simulacra-starters/blob/main/product_popularity_simulation_starter.ipynb), the [Stock Market Simulator](https://github.com/teaching-repositories/simulacra-starters/blob/main/stock_market_simulation_starter.ipynb), and the [Resource Fluctuations Simulator](https://github.com/teaching-repositories/simulacra-starters/blob/main/resource_flucuations_simulation_starter.ipynb). Below is a general overview of how to utilize these notebooks effectively:

**Getting Started**:

1. **Select Your Simulation**: Choose the notebook corresponding to the simulation you want to explore: Product Popularity, Stock Market, or Resource Fluctuations.

2. **Run the Simulation**: Each notebook contains classes or functions to run the simulation. Follow the instructions provided to generate simulated data and explore various scenarios.

3. **Visualize the Results**: Utilize the plotting functions within each notebook to graph and analyze the simulated data. These visualizations help you understand trends and patterns in the simulated scenarios.

**Objectives**:

- Analyze different aspects of the chosen simulation, such as consumer behavior, market trends, or resource management.
- Develop skills in data analysis and interpretation within specific domains.
- Enhance your programming proficiency, especially in utilizing Python libraries for simulation and visualization.

**Using Google Colab**:

- These notebooks are designed to be run on Google Colab, a cloud-based platform for executing Python code. You can work on these notebooks without any specific setups on your local machine.
- Remember to save a copy of the notebook in your Aasignment GitHub rep[ository to preserve your work and data.

**Preparation**:

- Familiarize yourself with the notebook's user interface and features, especially if you're new to Google Colab.
- Review the provided code snippets and accompanying explanatory texts within the notebook to understand how the simulation and plotting functions work.

## Additional Guidelines

- **Collaboration Policy:** Collaboration among students is encouraged to foster
  peer learning, however, all submitted work must be independently created.
- **Exploratory Approach:** You are encouraged to explore deeper into any specific
  aspects of the simulations that pique your interest. Investigate additional
  questions or scenarios beyond the basic assignment requirements.
