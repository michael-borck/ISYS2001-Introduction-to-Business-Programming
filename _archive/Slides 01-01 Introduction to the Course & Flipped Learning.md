# Introduction to the Course & Flipped Learning

## Slide 1: Welcome to the Course!

**Content:**
- Learn Python efficiently and effectively
- Build long-term programming skills
- Engage in hands-on coding
- Make learning fun and interactive

**Notes:**
Welcome to the course! This isn't just about reading and listening to lectures; it's about actively engaging with Python through coding exercises. By following this approach, you’ll not only learn Python quickly but also retain what you learn for the long term.

## Slide 2: A Flipped Classroom Approach

**Content:**
- Watch short tutorials before class
- Code during class with guidance
- Collaborate with peers
- Immediate feedback for better learning

**Notes:**
We’re using a flipped classroom model. This means you'll watch short tutorials and read materials before class. Then, in class, you'll apply what you've learned through exercises, discussions, and coding challenges, with the instructor and peers available to help.

## Slide 3: Tools You’ll Use

**Content:**
- **Google Colab** – Cloud-based Python coding
- **GitHub** – Version control & collaboration
- **Class Resources** – Guides, videos, and exercises

**Notes:**
We’ll use Google Colab for coding, so you don’t need to install anything. GitHub will help with version control and collaborative coding. All class materials, exercises, and instructions will be available through our course repository.
