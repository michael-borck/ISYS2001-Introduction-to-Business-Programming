# Mini Deck 6: Saving Notebooks to GitHub

## Slide 1: Why Use GitHub?

**Content:**
- **Version control** – Keep track of code changes over time.
- **Collaboration** – Work with peers and instructors.
- **Backup & Accessibility** – Access notebooks from any device.
- **Integration with Google Colab** – Save directly from Colab to GitHub.

**Notes:**
GitHub is a powerful tool that allows you to store and manage your Python notebooks securely. Using version control, you can track changes, collaborate on projects, and restore previous versions of your work. This is essential for maintaining clean and organized coding projects.

## Slide 2: Setting Up GitHub in Google Colab

**Content:**
- A **GitHub account** is required ([Sign up](https://github.com/))
- Authorize **Google Colab** to access GitHub.
- Create a new **repository** or use an existing one.

**Notes:**
Before saving notebooks to GitHub, you need a GitHub account and must allow Google Colab to interact with GitHub. You can either create a new repository or use an existing one to store your notebooks.

## Slide 3: Connecting Google Colab to GitHub

**Content:**
- Open **Google Colab**.
- Click **File > Save a Copy in GitHub**.
- Select a repository and add a commit message.
- Click **OK** to upload.

**Notes:**
In Google Colab, saving to GitHub is straightforward. This ensures your work is stored safely and is accessible from anywhere. The commit message helps keep track of changes.

## Slide 4: Retrieving and Updating Notebooks from GitHub

**Content:**
- Open a **GitHub repository**.
- Click on the **notebook file (.ipynb)**.
- Click **Open in Colab** to edit.
- After modifications, **save back to GitHub**.

**Notes:**
Once a notebook is stored on GitHub, you can easily access and edit it later. Simply open the notebook from GitHub and continue working in Colab. Be sure to save changes back to GitHub frequently.

## Slide 5: Best Practices for Saving Notebooks

**Content:**
- Write **clear commit messages** (e.g., "Updated data analysis section").
- Regularly **push updates** to GitHub to prevent data loss.
- Use **branches** for experimental changes before merging into the main repository.
- Keep notebooks **organized** within folders in your repository.

**Notes:**
Following best practices ensures that your notebooks remain well-documented and organized. Good commit messages help track progress, and using branches allows for safe experimentation without affecting the main codebase.

## Slide 6: Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Content:**
- **Authorization errors** – Ensure Google Colab has GitHub access.
- **Repository not showing?** – Refresh Colab or check GitHub permissions.
- **Failed to save?** – Check internet connection or re-authenticate.
- **Merge conflicts?** – Use GitHub to resolve conflicting changes.

**Notes:**
Sometimes, saving to GitHub may encounter issues like authorization errors or conflicts. These can be fixed by refreshing Colab, verifying permissions, or using GitHub’s conflict resolution tools.

## Slide 7: Hands-on Practice

**Content:**
- Save a sample notebook to GitHub.
- Retrieve and modify it from GitHub.
- Commit changes with a clear message.
- Open your updated notebook in Colab.

**Notes:**
The best way to learn is by doing! Try saving a test notebook to GitHub, retrieving it, making changes, and committing updates. This will give you hands-on experience with version control in Google Colab.
