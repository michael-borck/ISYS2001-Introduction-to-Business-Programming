## Introduction

This document outlines the motivation and outcome of revamping ISYS2001
Introduction to Business Programming and ISYS3015 Business Development to
better align the courses.

## Course Integration Strategy

These suggestions aim to create a more coherent learning experience across both
courses, ensuring that students see a clear progression in their skills and
knowledge. The weather dashboard project serves as a unifying element, allowing
students to apply increasingly complex concepts to a familiar problem domain.

1. Continuous Project Development: Extend the weather dashboard project from the
   introductory course into the advanced course. This provides a seamless
   transition and allows students to see how their skills progress.

2. Scaffolded Learning: Ensure that concepts introduced in the introductory
   course are built upon in the advanced course. For example, if students learn
   basic API usage in the intro course, expand on this with more complex API
   interactions and RESTful development in the advanced course.

3. Consistent Development Environment: Gradually introduce VSCode in the latter
   part of the introductory course to ease the transition to the advanced
   course. This provides continuity in the development environment across both
   courses.

4. Real-World Applications: Incorporate real-world scenarios and problems
   throughout both courses. This could involve using actual weather data APIs,
   collaborating with local meteorological services, or addressing
   climate-related issues through programming.

5. Collaborative Learning: Implement pair programming or group projects in both
   courses, with increasing complexity in the advanced course. This mirrors
   real-world software development practices.

6. Version Control Integration: Emphasise the use of Git and GitHub across both
   courses, introducing basic concepts in the intro course and more advanced
   features (like branching strategies and CI/CD) in the advanced course.

7. Code Review Process: Introduce peer code reviews in the introductory course
   and expand on this practice in the advanced course. This helps students
   develop critical analysis skills and learn from each other's code.

8. Documentation Practices: Start with basic documentation in the intro course
   (e.g., comments, basic README files) and progress to more comprehensive
   documentation in the advanced course (e.g., API documentation, technical
   specifications).

9. Testing Methodologies: Introduce simple unit tests in the introductory course
   and expand to more comprehensive testing strategies (integration tests, TDD)
   in the advanced course.

10. Ethical Considerations: Incorporate discussions on ethical implications of
    software development in both courses, with more in-depth exploration in the
    advanced course (e.g., data privacy in weather apps, environmental impact of
    software).

11. Industry Connection: Consider inviting guest speakers from the software
    industry or meteorological services to both courses, providing real-world
    context to the projects.

12. Portfolio Development: Encourage students to start building a portfolio in
    the introductory course and continue expanding it in the advanced course.
    This could be hosted on GitHub Pages, showcasing their progress across both
    courses.


## Benefits of Plan

1. Using Git and GitHub throughout provides students with valuable version
   control skills that are essential in the industry.

2.  Incorporating climate issues into the curriculum is a great way to make the
    content more relevant and engaging. It also helps students understand the
    real-world impact of their programming skills.

3.  Peer review assessment idea is innovative. It not only helps students
    improve their code but also develops their critical thinking and
    communication skills.

4.  The progression from docstrings in the introductory unit to type hints in
    the advanced unit introduces students to the concept of code documentation
    and then builds on it with more advanced practices.

5.  Using mkdocs from the command line in the introductory unit and integrating
    it with GitHub Actions in the advanced unit teaches both documentation and
    CI/CD concepts.

6.  Starting with simple test tables and assert statements, moving to doctests,
    and finally to pytest - provides a smooth learning curve for students.

7.  Integrating AI tools throughout both courses is forward-thinking. It
    prepares students for the reality of AI-assisted development while
    emphasising the importance of understanding the underlying concepts.

8.  The idea of learning by osmosis through engagement with the material is
    powerful, especially for the introductory unit.

The plan effectively bridges the gap between the two courses, providing a
coherent learning experience. The weather dashboard project serves as an
excellent thread tying everything together. This approach should give students a
solid foundation in programming while also exposing them to real-world
development practices.

## Benefits of using Weather Dashboard

The weather Dashboard is the scaffolded project across the units. Here are some
of the benefits of this approach.

1. **Universal Appeal and Accessibility**: Weather is a topic that everyone can
   relate to and understand, regardless of their background or field of study.
   This universal appeal makes it easier for students to engage with the project
   and see its real-world relevance.

2. **Business Relevance**: Weather data and forecasting have significant
   applications across various business sectors. This aligns well with the
   business school context and demonstrates the practical value of programming
   skills in business decision-making.

3. **Complexity and Scalability**: A weather dashboard can be as simple or as
   complex as needed, allowing for flexibility in project requirements. It can
   start with basic features and be expanded to include more advanced
   functionalities, catering to different skill levels within the class.

4. **API Integration**: Working with weather APIs provides valuable experience
   in handling real-world data sources, a crucial skill in modern business
   applications.

5. **Data Visualisation**: Creating a dashboard involves data visualisation,
   which is an important skill in business analytics and reporting.

6. **Reusability and Extensibility**: The components of a weather dashboard
   (like the WeatherAPI and WeatherModel classes) can be easily adapted for
   various business applications, showcasing the power of object-oriented
   design.

7. **Avoiding Financial Complexity**: Unlike a stock market dashboard, a weather
   dashboard doesn't require understanding complex financial concepts, making it
   more accessible to a broader range of students.

8. **Practical Skills Development**: The project encompasses various programming
   concepts including API usage, data processing, user interface design, and
   possibly database integration, providing a comprehensive learning experience.

While it's true that students can access weather information easily on their
devices, building a weather dashboard themselves offers a deeper understanding
of how such systems work and how they can be customised for specific business
needs. This hands-on experience is invaluable in bridging the gap between
theoretical knowledge and practical application.

The weather dashboard project effectively balances accessibility, business
relevance, and technical complexity, making it an excellent choice for your
advanced business programming unit. It provides students with a tangible,
relatable project that demonstrates the real-world application of their
programming skills in a business context.
