For publicly available bike share data, you can access comprehensive datasets from several major cities' bike share programs. These datasets typically include detailed trip records with information such as start and end times, start and end station names, and ride durations. Some sources to consider include:

1. **Citi Bike NYC** - Offers detailed historical trip data, including ride IDs, types of rides, start and end times, station names, and geographic coordinates of the stations. Data is available for public use and can be downloaded in CSV format. You can access Citi Bike's data [here](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data).

2. **Bluebikes Boston** - Provides trip data that includes trip duration, station names, and the demographics of riders such as birth year and gender. Bluebikes also offers real-time data in the General Bikeshare Feed Specification (GBFS) format. You can access Bluebikes' data [here](https://bluebikes.com/system-data).

3. **Bay Wheels by Lyft** - Publishes anonymized trip data which includes details like trip duration, station names, coordinates, and ride IDs. Real-time data is also available in GBFS format. You can access Bay Wheels' data [here](https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels/system-data).

For house prices data, it depends on the geographical area of interest. A commonly used source for U.S. housing data is the **Zillow Research Data** page. Zillow provides data on home values, rents, and other real estate metrics across various U.S. regions. You can explore Zillow's data offerings [here](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/). Another option is the **U.S. Census Bureau**, which offers extensive data on housing through its American Community Survey and other programs, accessible [here](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs).

These datasets are highly useful for analysis in urban planning, transportation, real estate, and economics research, providing a robust foundation for academic or professional projects.
