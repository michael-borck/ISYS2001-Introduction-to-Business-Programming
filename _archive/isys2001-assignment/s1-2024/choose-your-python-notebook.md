#### **Due, Friday May 24, 2024, 2024 by 11:59pm**

## Objective:

For this assessment, you will create an interactive Jupyter Notebook project that demonstrates your programming skills and understanding of core concepts. You may choose from one of the following four scenarios:

1. **Analysing Bike Sharing Data**
2. **Simulating a Simple Game**
3. **Predicting Housing Prices**
4. **Teaching Python Concepts in Jupyter Notebooks**

Regardless of the scenario you choose, your Jupyter Notebook project should include the following elements:

- Narrative explanations of your code, programming concepts, and insights
- Unit tests to ensure the robustness of your code
- Integration with GitHub for version control and collaboration

While you may use existing Jupyter Notebook examples and templates as a starting point, it is important that you make the project your own by adding unique features, insights, and implementations.

The assessment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Demonstration of programming concepts and skills
- Quality and clarity of your explanations and narrative
- Effective use of Jupyter Notebook features
- Proper integration with GitHub

## Ethical Use of AI and Large Language Models

While you are encouraged to leverage AI and large language models (LLMs) in your Jupyter Notebook project, it is crucial that you do so in a responsible and ethical manner. When using these powerful tools, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Transparency and Acknowledgement**: Clearly indicate in your Jupyter Notebook where you have used AI or LLMs, and provide appropriate citations and references to the models and tools you have employed. This ensures transparency and allows your instructor to properly evaluate your work.

2. **Avoid Misrepresentation**: Do not present the output of AI or LLMs as your own original work. Clearly distinguish between your own contributions and the generated content from the models.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can ensure that your use of AI and large language models in this assignment is both effective and responsible. If you have any questions or concerns regarding the ethical use of these technologies, please don't hesitate to reach out to your instructor.


## Submission Instructions

* Create your Jupyter Notebook project and store it in a GitHub repository.
* Ensure that your GitHub repository includes all the necessary files, including the Jupyter Notebook, any supporting files, and a README file.
* Compress your entire GitHub repository into a zip file.
* Submit the zip file of your GitHub repository via the link on the LMS Blackboard by the due date.
