# Active Learning & AI-Assisted Coding

## Slide 1: Learn Faster. Remember Longer.

**Content:**
- Hands-on learning boosts retention
- Read less, do more
- Build confidence, not frustration

**Notes:**
Passive learning, like just reading or watching lectures, doesn’t lead to long-term retention. Instead, this course emphasizes active learning—solving coding problems, experimenting, and getting immediate feedback. This will help you learn faster and remember concepts much longer.

## Slide 2: Learning by Doing

**Content:**
- Reading alone isn't enough
- Apply concepts through exercises
- Get instant feedback to reinforce learning

**Notes:**
Cognitive research shows that reading alone has low retention rates. Instead of just absorbing information, you'll practice coding immediately after learning a concept. This hands-on approach will help you internalize Python effectively.

## Slide 3: AI as Your Coding Assistant

**Content:**
- AI can help you generate and refine code
- Use AI for debugging and optimization
- AI-assisted learning boosts efficiency

**Notes:**
In this course, you'll leverage AI to assist in writing, debugging, and improving your code. Learning to work with AI will help you enhance problem-solving skills, structure code better, and gain efficiency.
