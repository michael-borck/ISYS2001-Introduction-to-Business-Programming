  - Students will store all lab projects and assignments on GitHub.
  - Each Colab notebook will include an **"Open in Colab" button** for quick access.
  - Encourages version control best practices while keeping work organized.

- **Limitations**

  - **No local GUI applications (Tkinter, PyQt, etc.)** – This course focuses on data processing rather than application development.
  - Students will primarily work with **data files (CSV, Excel, APIs)** rather than standalone applications.

### **How to Use Google Colab with GitHub**

To make collaboration and version control easier, students will follow these steps:

1. **Creating a GitHub Repository**
   - Sign up or log in to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
   - Create a new repository for lab projects and assignments.
   - Set the repository to public or private, depending on preference.

2. **Uploading Colab Notebooks to GitHub**
   - In Google Colab, go to **File → Save a copy in GitHub**.
   - Select the correct repository and commit message.
   - The notebook is now saved and version-controlled in GitHub.

3. **Opening Notebooks from GitHub in Colab**
   - In GitHub, navigate to the desired notebook.
   - Click the **"Open in Colab"** button (this can be manually added to README files).
   - Edit and run the notebook directly in Google Colab.

4. **Pulling Updates from GitHub**
   - If an instructor updates a starter template on GitHub, students can use **!git pull** inside a Colab cell to fetch updates.
   
By following this workflow, students will learn **basic version control principles** while keeping their work organized and accessible.

## **Assessments & Grading**
| **Assessment** | **Weight** |
|--------------|----------|
| **Lab Exit Tickets (Weeks 1-8)** – AI-assisted reflections & debugging | 20% |
| **Final Programming Project** – AI-assisted business application | 40% |
| **Applied Programming Portfolio (Final Assessment)** | 40% |

### **Assessment Description**
- **Lab Exit Tickets:** Each lab session ends with a **reflection** on AI-generated code and modifications.
- **Weekly Lab Projects (Self-Assessed):** Students complete hands-on, AI-assisted coding challenges but self-assess their learning.
- **Final Programming Project:** A real-world Python project where students use AI to assist in development, debugging, and optimization.
- **Applied Programming Portfolio:** A final written submission reflecting on AI-assisted learning, prompt engineering, and coding progress.

---

## **Course Policies**
- **AI Usage:** AI is encouraged but must be used **transparently**. Students must reflect on AI-generated code and explain modifications.
- **Academic Integrity:** While AI assistance is allowed, plagiarism from external sources without understanding the content is not.
- **Collaboration:** Peer discussions are encouraged, but final submissions must reflect individual learning.
- **Late Submissions:** Late work will receive a **5% penalty per day** unless prior arrangements are made.

## **Assessment & Pass Requirements**

### **To Pass This Unit, Students Must:**

1. **Achieve a Final Mark of 50 or greater.**

2. **Achieve at least 40% in the Final Programming Project.**  
   *This ensures students engage with the major practical component and do not pass by only completing minor tasks. The Final Project reflects the core skills developed throughout the unit and is critical for demonstrating overall competency.*

3. **Submit at least 6 out of 8 Lab Exit Tickets.**  
   *This requirement encourages students to participate consistently in labs, reinforcing their understanding through hands-on exercises. Regular participation has been shown to improve learning outcomes and retention of programming concepts.*

4. **Submit Meaningful Work.**
   - Assignments submitted more than **7 days late** will receive an automatic score of **0%**, as per the **Late Assessment Policy**.
   - Students must submit **meaningful work**—submitting a blank or incomplete assignment to avoid a 0% score will **not be accepted**.
   - Any requests for **late submissions** must include **evidence of progress** on the assignment (e.g., partial work, code screenshots) before an extension is considered.

   *This requirement prevents students from submitting empty files to bypass the late penalty. If students need extra time, they should demonstrate progress by submitting partial work or requesting an extension with valid reasons.*

These requirements ensure that students stay engaged, complete key learning objectives, and do not rely solely on last-minute efforts.
