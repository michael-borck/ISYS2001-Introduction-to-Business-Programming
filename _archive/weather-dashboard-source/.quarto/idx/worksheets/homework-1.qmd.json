Answer the following questions to the best of your ability.\n\n\n1. **Creating Variables**\n    - Write a Python statement to create a variable named `name` and assign it the value `\"Alice\"`.\n\n    ```{python}\n    # Your code here\n    ```\n\n2. **Creating Variables**\n    - Create two variables: `age` with the value `30` and `height` with the value `5.9`.\n\n    ```{python}\n    # Your code here\n    ```\n\n3. **Simple If-Then Statement**\n    - Write an if-then statement that prints \"You are an adult.\" if the variable `age` is greater than or equal to 18.\n\n    ```{python}\n    age = 20  # You can change this value for testing\n\n    # Your code here\n    ```\n\n4. **Simple If-Then Statement**\n    - Write an if-then statement that checks if a number stored in the variable `number` is positive. If it is, print \"The number is positive.\"\n\n    ```{python}\n    number = 5  # You can change this value for testing\n\n    # Your code here\n    ```\n\n5. **Basic Loops**\n    - Write a for loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 5.\n\n    ```{python}\n    # Your code here\n    ```\n\n6. **Basic Loops**\n    - Write a while loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 5.\n\n    ```{python}\n    i = 1\n\n    # Your code here\n    ```\n\n7. **Combining Variables and If-Then Statements**\n    - Create a variable `temperature` with the value `75`. Write an if-then statement that prints \"It's warm outside.\" if `temperature` is greater than or equal to 70.\n\n    ```{python}\n    temperature = 75\n\n    # Your code here\n    ```\n\n8. **Using Loops with If-Then Statements**\n    - Write a for loop that iterates over the list `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and prints each number only if it is even.\n\n    ```{python}\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n    # Your code here\n    ```\n\n9. **Modifying Variables in Loops**\n    - Write a while loop that starts with a variable `count` set to 0 and increments `count` by 1 each iteration. The loop should stop when `count` reaches 10, and the value of `count` should be printed at the end.\n\n    ```{python}\n    count = 0\n\n    # Your code here\n    ```\n\n10. **Nested Loops**\n    - Write a nested loop that prints a 3x3 grid of asterisks (`*`).\n\n    ```{python}\n    # Your code here\n    ```\n\n11. **Using `print` Function**\n    - Write a Python program that prints \"Hello, World!\" to the console.\n\n    ```{python}\n    # Your code here\n    ```\n\n12. **Using `input` Function**\n    - Write a Python program that prompts the user for their name and then prints a greeting message with their name. For example, if the user inputs \"Alice\", the program should print \"Hello, Alice!\".\n\n    ```{python}\n    # Your code here\n    ```\n\n\n#### Additional Notes:\n- Make sure to test your code by running it in a Python environment.\n- Feel free to modify variable values to test different scenarios.\n- Practice writing clean and readable code by using proper indentation and comments.\n\n\n#### Conclusion:\nThis worksheet provides a fundamental review of Python programming basics. Ensure you understand each concept thoroughly before moving on to more advanced topics.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n#### Objective:\nThis worksheet is designed to review the basics of Python programming, including creating variables, simple if-then statements, basic loops, using print, and handling input.
