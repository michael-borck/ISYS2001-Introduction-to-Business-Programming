{"title":"Worksheet: Python Programming Fundamentals with Temperature and Weather Themes","markdown":{"headingText":"Worksheet: Python Programming Fundamentals with Temperature and Weather Themes","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"Creating a worksheet that gradually increases in difficulty while incorporating themes of temperature, weather, and related concepts sounds like a great way to reinforce learning across different programming fundamentals. Here's a sample worksheet with 30 questions, starting from basic concepts and gradually becoming more challenging. Each question is designed to utilize basic Python, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, tkinter, JupyterLab, and GitHub, focusing on the specified themes. \n\n\n#### Section 1: Basic Concepts\n\n1. **Python Basics**\n   - Write a Python program that prints \"Hello, World!\".\n\n2. **Variables and Data Types**\n   - Define a variable `temperature` and assign it a value of 25.5. Print the temperature.\n\n3. **Input and Output**\n   - Prompt the user to enter today's temperature in Celsius using `input()`. Convert the input to a float and print it.\n\n4. **Conditional Statements**\n   - Write a program that checks if a temperature (`temp`) is above 30°C and prints \"It's a hot day!\" if true, otherwise print \"Enjoy the weather!\".\n\n5. **Loops**\n   - Use a loop to print temperatures from 20°C to 25°C.\n\n#### Section 2: Data Handling with pandas and NumPy\n\n6. **Data Handling**\n   - Create a pandas DataFrame with columns: `Date` and `Temperature`. Add rows for three days with temperatures: [25.5, 28.0, 30.5]. Display the DataFrame.\n\n7. **Data Manipulation**\n   - Calculate the average temperature from the DataFrame created in question 6 using pandas.\n\n8. **Array Operations**\n   - Use NumPy to create an array `temperatures` with values [23.0, 24.5, 26.0, 27.5]. Print the maximum temperature from this array.\n\n9. **DataFrame Filtering**\n   - Filter the DataFrame from question 6 to show days where the temperature was above 28°C.\n\n#### Section 3: Visualization with Matplotlib\n\n10. **Simple Plotting**\n    - Plot the temperatures from question 8 using Matplotlib. Label the x-axis as \"Day\" and y-axis as \"Temperature (°C)\".\n\n11. **Customization**\n    - Enhance the plot from question 10 with a title \"Weekly Temperature Variation\" and grid lines.\n\n12. **Multiple Plots**\n    - Create a subplot with two plots: one for temperatures from question 6 and another for temperatures from question 8.\n\n#### Section 4: GUI Development with tkinter\n\n13. **Basic GUI**\n    - Create a tkinter GUI window that displays a label showing today's temperature.\n\n14. **Input and Buttons**\n    - Design a GUI where users can input a temperature in Celsius, convert it to Fahrenheit, and display the result when clicking a button.\n\n#### Section 5: Advanced Applications\n\n15. **API Integration**\n    - Use a Python library to fetch real-time weather data (temperature, humidity) from an online API and display it.\n\n16. **File Handling**\n    - Write a Python program that reads temperature data from a CSV file and calculates the average temperature.\n\n17. **Error Handling**\n    - Implement error handling in a program that prompts the user for a temperature input. Ensure the program handles non-numeric inputs gracefully.\n\n#### Section 6: Project Integration with GitHub and JupyterLab\n\n18. **Version Control**\n    - Describe how GitHub can be used for version control in a programming project like building a weather dashboard.\n\n19. **Documentation**\n    - Explain the importance of documentation in programming projects. How would you use JupyterLab and markdown cells for documentation?\n\n20. **Collaboration**\n    - Discuss how multiple developers can collaborate on a Python project using GitHub, focusing on branch management and pull requests.\n\n#### Section 7: Review and Synthesis\n\n21. **Problem-Solving Framework**\n    - Use the 5-step problem-solving framework (understand, inputs/outputs, work by hand, pseudo code, test) to outline a program that converts Fahrenheit to Celsius.\n\n22. **Integration of Concepts**\n    - Develop a program that reads weather data from a CSV file, filters temperatures above 25°C, and plots the results using Matplotlib.\n\n23. **Complex GUI Design**\n    - Design a tkinter-based GUI for a weather dashboard that displays current weather conditions (temperature, humidity) using data fetched from an API.\n\n24. **Data Analysis**\n    - Analyze temperature data collected over a week, calculate the average temperature, and visualize daily fluctuations using pandas and Matplotlib.\n\n25. **Optimization**\n    - Optimize a program that fetches weather data from an API by implementing caching mechanisms to reduce API calls and improve performance.\n\n#### Section 8: Advanced Challenges\n\n26. **Data Interpolation**\n    - Implement a program that interpolates missing temperature data points in a time series dataset using NumPy or pandas.\n\n27. **Statistical Analysis**\n    - Conduct statistical analysis on temperature data collected over a month, including mean, median, and standard deviation calculations.\n\n28. **Dynamic Visualization**\n    - Create a dynamic visualization using Matplotlib that updates in real-time as new temperature data is fetched from an API.\n\n29. **Error Analysis**\n    - Develop a program that analyzes temperature data for outliers (extreme values) and suggests corrective actions based on statistical analysis.\n\n30. **Project Integration**\n    - Integrate all concepts learned into a comprehensive weather dashboard project using Python, pandas, Matplotlib, tkinter, and GitHub for version control and collaboration.\n\n---\n\nThis worksheet progresses from fundamental Python concepts to more advanced topics, incorporating temperature and weather themes throughout. It encourages practical application of programming skills while familiarizing learners with essential libraries and tools commonly used in Python development. Adjust the difficulty level of questions as needed based on learners' proficiency and learning objectives.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"0":"*.qmd","1":"!*.ipynb","keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"worksheet.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
