Please enter a valid number.\")\n```\n\n\n# Decision Making (If/Then Structures)\n- Boolean Expressions\n-  Relational Operators:  `<, >, <=, >=`\n-  Logical Operators: `and, or, not`\n- Simple `if`, `if-else`, `if-elif-else` Statements\n\n\n# Decision Example\n\n```python\ntemperature = input(\"Enter today's temperature in Celsius: \")\ntemperature = float(temperature)  # Convert input to float\n\nif temperature > 30:\n    print(\"It's a hot day!\")\nelif temperature < 10:\n    print(\"It's a cold day.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"It's a moderate day.\")\n```\n\n\n# Repetition (Loops)\n- `for` Loops\n- `while` Loops\n- list/dictionary comprehension\n- Nested Loops (Conceptual)\n- recursion\n\n\n# `for` Loops\n\n`for` loops are used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) or other iterable objects. The basic syntax is:\n```python\nfor variable in iterable:\n    # code to be executed\n```\nHere, `variable` takes on the value of each element in the `iterable` object, and the code inside the loop is executed for each iteration.\n\n# `for` Loop Example:\n```python\nfruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\nfor fruit in fruits:\n    print(fruit)\n```\nOutput:\n```\napple\nbanana\ncherry\n```\n\n#  `while` Loops\n\n`while` loops are used to execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. The basic syntax is:\n```python\nwhile condition:\n    # code to be executed\n```\nHere, the code inside the loop is executed as long as the `condition` is true.\n\n# `while` Loop Example:\n```python\ni = 0\nwhile i < 3:\n    print(i)\n    i += 1\n```\nOutput:\n```\n0\n1\n2\n```\n#  List/Dictionary Comprehension\n\nList and dictionary comprehensions are concise ways to create new lists or dictionaries from existing iterables. The basic syntax is:\n```python\nnew_list = [expression for element in iterable]\nnew_dict = {key: value for element in iterable}\n```\nHere, `expression` is evaluated for each element in the `iterable`, and the results are collected in a new list or dictionary.\n\n# Comprehension Example:\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nsquared_numbers = [x**2 for x in numbers]\nprint(squared_numbers)  # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n```\n\n# Nested Loops\n```python\nfor i in range(3):\n    for j in range(2):\n        print(f\"i: {i}, j: {j}\")\n```\nOutput:\n```\ni: 0, j: 0\ni: 0, j: 1\ni: 1, j: 0\ni: 1, j: 1\ni: 2, j: 0\ni: 2, j: 1\n```\n\n# Recursion\nRecursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself repeatedly until a base case is reached. The basic syntax is:\n```python\ndef function(arg):\n    if base_case:\n        return result\n    else:\n        return function(arg)\n```\nHere, the function calls itself with a new argument until the base case is reached, at which point the function returns a result.\n\n# Recursion Example\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n-1)\nprint(factorial(5))  # 120\n```\n\n\n# Managing Complexity with Functions\n1. **Code Reusability**: You can write a function once and use it multiple times throughout your program, reducing code duplication.\n2. **Modularity**: Functions help organise your code into smaller, independent units that are easier to understand and maintain.\n3. **Abstraction**: Functions can hide complex logic and implementation details, making it easier to use them without worrying about the inner workings.\n\n# Function Components and Syntax\n\n1. **Function Name**: A unique name given to the function, which is used to call it.\n2. **Parameters**: Optional values that are passed to the function when it's called. Parameters are used to customise the function's behavior.\n3. **Return Statement**: An optional statement that returns a value from the function.\n4. **Function Body**: The code that's executed when the function is called.\n\n# Function example\n```python\ndef greet(name) {\n  print(f'Hello, {name}!')\n}\n\ngreet(\"John\") # Output: Hello, John!\n```\n\n# Best Practices for Writing Functions\n\n1. **Keep it Simple**: Functions should perform a single, well-defined task.\n2. **Use Meaningful Names**: Choose function names that clearly indicate what the function does.\n3. **Use Parameters**: Pass parameters to customise the function's behavior.\n4. **Return Values**: Use return statements to provide useful values to the caller.\n5. **Test Thoroughly**: Write tests to ensure your functions work correctly and handle edge cases.\n\n\n# Data Structures: Tuples, Lists, Dictionaries and Sets\n- Tuples: storing immutable values\n- Lists: Storing Sequences of Values\n- Dictionaries: Key-Value Pairs for Data Organisation\n- Sets: Storing unique values\n\n\n# Tuples: Storing Immutable Values\n\n```python\nmy_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\nprint(my_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\n# Trying to modify the tuple will raise a TypeError\nmy_tuple[0] = 10  # Raises TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n```\n# Lists: Storing Sequences of Values\n\n```python\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n# Modifying the list is allowed\nmy_list.append(6)\nprint(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\n# Dictionaries: Key-Value Pairs for Data Organisation\n\n```python\nmy_dict = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"New York\"}\nprint(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}\n\n# Accessing values using keys\nprint(my_dict[\"name\"])  # Output: John\nprint(my_dict[\"age\"])  # Output: 30\n\n# Modifying values is allowed\nmy_dict[\"age\"] = 31\nprint(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'John', 'age': 31, 'city': 'New York'}\n```\n\n# Sets: Storing Unique Values\n\n```python\nmy_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nprint(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\n# Adding a duplicate value will not change the set\nmy_set.add(5)\nprint(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\n# Removing a value is allowed\nmy_set.remove(3)\nprint(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 4, 5}\n```\n\n\n# Common List operations\n\nA List in Python is a collection of items that can be of any data type, including strings, integers, floats, and other lists. Lists are denoted by square brackets `[]` and are ordered, meaning that the order of items matters.\n\n* **Indexing**: Allows accessing specific elements using their position in the data structure. Only lists support indexing.\n* **Slicing**: Allows extracting a subset of elements from a list. Only lists support slicing.\n* **Append**: Adds new elements to the end of a list. Only lists support appending.\n* **Insert**: Inserts new elements at a specific position in a list. Only lists support inserting.\n* **Remove**: Removes elements from a list. Only lists support removing.\n\n# Examples\n* Indexing: `my_list[0]` returns the first element of the list.\n* Slicing: `my_list[1:3]` returns the elements at indices 1 and 2.\n* Append: `my_list.append(\"new element\")` adds a new element to the end of the list.\n* Insert: `my_list.insert(1, \"new element\")` inserts a new element at index 1.\n* Remove: `my_list.remove(\"old element\")` removes the first occurrence of the element \"old element\" from the list.\n\n`Note that tuples, dictionaries, and sets do not support these operations. Tuples are immutable, dictionaries are key-value pairs, and sets are unordered collections of unique elements.`\n\n# Modules and Packages\n- Functions: Group of statement\n- Class: Group of functions and data\n- Modules: Grouping Functions (or classes)\n- Packages: Collections of Modules\n\n# Problem Solving Framework\n- Understand the problem\n- Identify input/output\n- Work the problem by hand (early test cases)\n- Write pseudo code and convert to python\n- Test with variety of data\n\n# **Understand the Problem**\n- Read and re-read the problem statement to ensure you understand what is being asked.\n- Identify the key elements of the problem, including:\n    - Inputs: What data will the program need to solve the problem?\n    - Outputs: What results should the program produce?\n    - Constraints: Are there any limitations or rules that the program must follow?\n\n#  **Identify Input/Output**\n- Determine the types and formats of the input data.\n- Identify the expected output format and any specific requirements (e.g., precision, formatting).\n\n#  **Work the Problem by Hand (Early Test Cases)**\n- Choose a few simple test cases to work through by hand.\n- Verify that your manual calculations produce the expected output.\n  - This step helps you understand the problem better and identify any potential issues.\n\n#  **Write Pseudo Code and Convert to Python**\n- Write pseudo code to describe the steps your program will take to solve the problem.\n- Convert the pseudo code to Python, using a top-down approach to structure your code.\n- Focus on one component at a time, and make sure each part is working correctly before moving on to the next.\n\n# **Test with Variety of Data**\n- Write test cases to verify that your program produces the expected output for a variety of input data.\n- Use a range of inputs, including edge cases and unusual data, to ensure your program is robust and reliable.\n- Test your program in different environments and configurations to ensure it works as expected.\n\n\n# **Step 1 - Understand the Problem**\n\nLet's go through each step to develop a simple program to convert temperature from Kelvin to Celsius.\n\n- Define the Problem: Kelvin to Celsius Conversion\n\nThe problem is to write a program that takes a temperature in Kelvin as input and returns the equivalent temperature in Celsius.  This is simple, but in real life probably interview the client, do some independent research, chat to experts, read research papers, study existing programs etc.\n\n# **Step 2 - Define Inputs and Outputs**\n\n- Input: Kelvin Temperature (a single number, e.g., 273.15)\n- Output: Celsius Temperature (a single number, e.g., 0.15)\n\n# **Step 3 - Work the Problem by Hand**\n\n> Let's convert 273.15 Kelvin to Celsius. We know that the conversion formula is:\n>\n> Celsius = Kelvin - 273.15\n>\n> So, we subtract 273.15 from 273.15 to get:\n> \n> Celsius = 0.15\n\nThis manual calculation shows that the program should subtract 273.15 from the input Kelvin temperature to get the equivalent Celsius temperature.\n\n# **Step 4 - Write Pseudo Code**\n\nThis pseudo code defines the algorithm for the conversion. It takes the input Kelvin temperature, subtracts 273.15, and prints the result.\n\n```\ninput_kelvin = get kelvin temperature\ncelsius = input_kelvin - 273.15\nprint celsius\n```\n\n```python\ninput_kelvin = input(\"Please input temperature in Kelvin\")\ncelsius = input_kelvin - 273.15\nprint(celsius)\n```\n\n\n# **Step 5 - Test with Data**\n\n- Test Cases: Valid and Invalid Inputs\n- Valid Inputs:\n    - 273.15 Kelvin -> 0.15 Celsius\n    - 0 Kelvin -> -273.15 Celsius\n  - 500 Kelvin -> 226.85 Celsius\n- Invalid Inputs:\n    - Negative Kelvin (e.g., -273.15) -> Error handling needed\n    - Non-numeric input (e.g., \"abc\") -> Error handling needed\n- Handling Edge Cases (Negative Kelvin):\n  - We'll add error handling to handle negative Kelvin inputs. For example, we could print an error message and return an error code.\n\n\n# Final Python program:\n```python\ndef kelvin_to_celsius(kelvin):\n    if kelvin < 0:\n        print(\"Error: Negative Kelvin temperature\")\n        return None\n    celsius = kelvin - 273.15\n    return celsius\n\n# Test cases\nprint(kelvin_to_celsius(273.15))  # 0.15\nprint(kelvin_to_celsius(0))  # -273.15\nprint(kelvin_to_celsius(500))  # 226.85\n\n# Invalid inputs\nprint(kelvin_to_celsius(-273.15))  # Error: Negative Kelvin temperature\nprint(kelvin_to_celsius(\"abc\"))  # Error: Non-numeric input\n```\n\n# Using Jupyter Notebooks for Prototyping\n- Rapid Prototyping\n- Interactive Development Environment\n- Collaboration\n- Data Exploration\n- Immediate feedback\n- Reproducible\n\n\n::: {.notes}\n\n**Benefits of Jupyter Notebooks:**\n\n1. **Rapid Prototyping**: Jupyter Notebooks allow you to quickly write and execute code, making it an ideal tool for rapid prototyping.

This helps you create a robust, maintainable, and scalable program that can be used by others.\n\n:::\n\n\n# Introduction to Version Control with GitHub\n\n- Keeps track of changes made\n- Allows for easy collaboration\n- Provides a backup of code\n- Helps resolve conflicts\n- Improves code quality\n- Git:  local command line version control\n- GitHub: Web-based platform for version control\n\n\n# File Input/Output Operations\n\nFile input/output operations allow your program to read and write data to files on the file system.\n\nPython has several built-in functions for working with files, including:\n\n* `open()` to open a file\n* `read()` to read the contents of a file\n* `write()` to write data to a file\n* `close()` to close a file\n\n# File I/O Example\n```python\nwith open(\"example.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n    file.write(\"Hello, world!\")\n\nwith open(\"example.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    print(file.read())\n```\n\nNote: The `with` statement is used to ensure that the file is properly closed, even if an exception is thrown.\n\n\n# Introduction to Databases**\n\nA database is a collection of organised data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. In programming, databases are used to store and retrieve data efficiently.\n\nPython has several libraries for working with databases, including:\n\n- `sqlite3` for SQLite databases\n- `psycopg2` for PostgreSQL databases\n- `mysql-connector-python` for MySQL databases\n\n# Database Example\n```python\nimport sqlite3\n\n# Create a connection to the database\nconn = sqlite3.connect(\"example.db\")\n\n# Create a cursor object\ncursor = conn.cursor()\n\n# Create a table\ncursor.execute(\"\"\"\n    CREATE TABLE users (\n        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n        name TEXT,\n        email TEXT\n    );\n\"\"\")\n\n# Insert some data\ncursor.execute(\"INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'johndoe@example.com')\")\n\n# Commit the changes\nconn.commit()\n\n# Close the connection\nconn.close()\n```\n\n\n# Data Visualisation**\n\n1. **Data**: The raw information being visualised.\n2. **Visualisation**: The graphical representation of the data.\n3. **Chart type**: The specific type of visualisation used, such as bar charts, line charts, or scatter plots.\n4. **Aesthetics**: The visual elements used to enhance the visualisation, such as colors, fonts, and layouts.\n5. **Interactivity**: The ability to interact with the visualisation, such as sooming, hovering, or clicking.\n\n# Matplotlib\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Sample data\nx = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ny = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n\n# Create the figure and axis\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n# Plot the data\nax.plot(x, y)\n\n# Set the title and labels\nax.set_title('Simple Line Chart')\nax.set_xlabel('X Axis')\nax.set_ylabel('Y Axis')\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\n#  Web Scraping\n\nWeb scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites. It involves sending an HTTP request to a website, receiving the HTML response, and then parsing the HTML to extract the desired data. Web scraping is useful for data mining, data analysis, and automation.\n\n\n# Simple Web Scrape Example\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\n# Send an HTTP request to the website\nurl = \"https://www.example.com\"\nresponse = requests.get(url)\n\n# Parse the HTML response using BeautifulSoup\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, \"html.parser\")\n\n# Find all the links on the webpage\nlinks = soup.find_all(\"a\")\nfor link in links:\n    print(link.get(\"href\"))\n```\n\n# Web Scraping Tips\n\n* Always check the website's terms of use and robots.txt file to make sure web scraping is allowed.\n* Be respectful of the website and don't overload it with requests.\n* Handle errors and exceptions properly.\n* Use a user agent to identify yourself and avoid being blocked.\n* Consider using a proxy server to hide your IP address.\n\n\n\n# API - Application Programming Interface\n\nAPIs are a set of defined rules that enables different applications, services, or systems to communicate with each other. It allows data to be shared, processed, and used by different systems, making it a crucial part of modern software development.\n\n# Basics of APIs**\n\n- **API Type**: There are several types of APIs, including:\n    - **Web API**: A web API is an API that is accessed over the web, typically using HTTP requests and responses.\n    - **RESTful API**: A RESTful API is a type of web API that follows the REST (Representational State of Resource) architecture.\n    - **SOAP API**: A SOAP API is a type of web API that uses the SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) protocol.\n- **API Endpoint**: An API endpoint is a specific URL that is used to access a particular resource or functionality.\n- **API Request**: An API request is a request sent to an API endpoint to retrieve or modify data.\n- **API Response**: An API response is the data returned by the API in response to an API request.\n- **API Key**: An API key is a unique string of characters that is used to authenticate and authorise API requests.\n\n# Web API Example\n\n**API Endpoint**: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1`\n**API Request**: `GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1`\n**API Response**:\n```json\n{\n  \"userId\": 1,\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"title\": \"delectus aut autem\",\n  \"completed\": false\n}\n```\n\n# Web API Python Code\n```python\nimport requests\n\n# Send a GET request to the API endpoint\nresponse = requests.get(\"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1\")\n\n# Check if the response was successful\nif response.status_code == 200:\n    # Parse the JSON response\n    data = response.json()\n    print(data)\nelse:\n    print(\"Error:\", response.status_code)\n```\n\n# API Tips\n\n- Always check the API documentation to understand the available endpoints, request methods, and response formats.\n- Use the correct API key or authentication method to access the API.\n- Handle errors and exceptions properly.\n- Use a library like `requests` to simplify API requests and responses.\n\n\n# GUIs with Tkinter**\n\nA Graphical User Interface (GUI) is a type of user interface that allows users to interact with a computer program using visual elements such as windows, buttons, and menus. GUIs are designed to be more intuitive and user-friendly than command-line interfaces.\n\nTkinter is a Python binding to the Tk GUI toolkit. It is the standard Python interface to Tk and is bundled with most standard Python distributions.\n\n# Basics of Graphical User Interfaces**\n\n- **Widgets**: A widget is a basic building block of a GUI. Examples of widgets include buttons, labels, text boxes, and menus.\n- **Layout**: The layout of a GUI refers to the arrangement of widgets on the screen. This can be done using various layout managers such as grid, pack, and place.\n- **Events**: Events are actions that occur when a user interacts with a GUI, such as clicking a button or typing in a text box. GUIs use event handlers to respond to these events.\n\n# GUI Example**\n\n```python\nimport tkinter as tk\n\ndef create_widgets(master):\n    # Button to display \"Hello World\" and print a message on click\n    hi_there = tk.Button(master, text=\"Hello World\\n(click me)\", command=say_hi)\n    hi_there.pack(side=\"top\")\n    \n    # Button to quit the application\n    quit_button = tk.Button(master, text=\"QUIT\", fg=\"red\", command=master.destroy)\n    quit_button.pack(side=\"bottom\")\n\ndef say_hi():\n    print(\"hi there, everyone!\")\n\n# Create the main window\nroot = tk.Tk()\n\n# Call the function to create widgets\ncreate_widgets(root)\n\n# Start the main event loop\nroot.mainloop()\n```\n\n# GUI Tips\n\n- Always use a consistent layout and design for your GUI.\n- Use meaningful and descriptive names for your widgets and variables.\n- Handle events and errors properly.\n- Use a GUI builder or IDE to simplify the process of building GUIs.\n\n\n# Conclusion - Recap of Learning Points\n\n- **Data Representation and Types** Computers store and interpret data as binary sequences (0s and 1s), with data types defining how these sequences are understood and manipulated (e.g., as numbers, text, or multimedia).\n- **Six Fundamental Operations:** Mastering these operations provides the foundation for all programming tasks, enabling you to gather, process, and present data effectively.\n- **Problem-Solving Framework:** This structured approach helps break down complex problems into manageable steps, ensuring a systematic and thorough solution.\n\nUnderstanding data representation and types is fundamental to all aspects of programming.

These binary sequences form the basis for all types of data a computer can handle. The concept of data types is crucial because it tells the computer how to interpret these binary sequences, whether as numbers, text, images, sound, or more complex structures like documents and videos. Here's a deeper look at how data representation and types are foundational and their relationship to the six fundamental operations and the problem-solving framework:\n\n#### How Data Representation and Types Relate to the Six Fundamental Operations:\n\n1. **Input:**\n   - **Relevance:** When inputting data into a program, knowing the data type is essential for correctly interpreting and processing the input. For instance, user inputs are often strings that may need conversion to other types (e.g., integers or floats) for calculations.\n   - **Example:** Reading a temperature input as a string and converting it to a float for further processing.\n\n2. **Output:**\n   - **Relevance:** When outputting data, the format and type must be considered to ensure the information is presented correctly. Different data types may require different formatting techniques.\n   - **Example:** Displaying a temperature value with appropriate units (°C or °F) and ensuring it's correctly formatted as a number.\n\n3. **Calculation:**\n   - **Relevance:** Calculations require an understanding of numeric data types (integers, floats) to perform arithmetic operations accurately.\n   - **Example:** Converting temperatures between different scales involves arithmetic operations on float values.\n\n4. **Store/Assignment:**\n   - **Relevance:** Storing data in variables requires assigning appropriate types to ensure correct manipulation and retrieval. Data types dictate the operations that can be performed on the stored data.\n   - **Example:** Assigning a temperature reading to a float variable and later updating it based on new input.\n\n5. **Make Decisions (If/Then):**\n   - **Relevance:** Decision-making relies on Boolean expressions that often compare values of specific types. The result of these comparisons dictates the program’s flow.\n   - **Example:** Checking if a temperature value exceeds a certain threshold to determine whether it's hot or cold.\n\n6. **Going Loopy (for, while):**\n   - **Relevance:** Iterating over collections of data (like lists or arrays) requires understanding the data type of elements being processed to apply appropriate operations.\n   - **Example:** Looping through a list of temperature readings to find the highest value.\n\n#### How Data Representation and Types Relate to the Problem-Solving Framework:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - **Importance:** Identifying the types of data involved is crucial for defining the problem accurately. This step sets the stage for deciding how data will be handled throughout the solution.\n   - **Example:** Recognising that temperatures need to be processed as floats for accurate conversion between scales.\n\n2. **Define Inputs and Outputs:**\n   - **Importance:** Clearly defining data types for inputs and outputs ensures that the solution will handle data correctly and predictably.\n   - **Example:** Specifying that input temperatures will be floats and output temperatures will be formatted strings.\n\n3. **Work the Problem by Hand:**\n   - **Importance:** Manually solving the problem with known data types helps in understanding the operations required and ensures the logical correctness of the approach.\n   - **Example:** Manually converting a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius, noting the arithmetic operations involved.\n\n4. **Write Pseudo Code:**\n   - **Importance:** Pseudo code helps in abstracting the problem and specifying data types without worrying about syntax, ensuring the logical flow is sound.\n   - **Example:** Outlining steps for temperature conversion, including type conversion operations.\n\n5. **Convert to Python Code:**\n   - **Importance:** Translating pseudo code to Python involves explicitly defining and using data types correctly to implement the solution.\n   - **Example:** Implementing the conversion algorithm with correct type handling in Python.\n\n6. **Test with Data:**\n   - **Importance:** Testing the program with various data types ensures that all edge cases and typical scenarios are handled correctly, confirming the robustness of the solution.\n   - **Example:** Testing the temperature conversion function with a range of input values, ensuring accurate outputs.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nUnderstanding data representation and types is fundamental to all aspects of programming. It underpins how input is processed, calculations are performed, decisions are made, and output is generated.

The basic syntax is:\n```python\nfor variable in iterable:\n    # code to be executed\n```\nHere, `variable` takes on the value of each element in the `iterable` object, and the code inside the loop is executed for each iteration.\n\n# `for` Loop Example:\n```python\nfruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\nfor fruit in fruits:\n    print(fruit)\n```\nOutput:\n```\napple\nbanana\ncherry\n```\n\n#  `while` Loops\n\n`while` loops are used to execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. The basic syntax is:\n```python\nwhile condition:\n    # code to be executed\n```\nHere, the code inside the loop is executed as long as the `condition` is true.\n\n# `while` Loop Example:\n```python\ni = 0\nwhile i < 3:\n    print(i)\n    i += 1\n```\nOutput:\n```\n0\n1\n2\n```\n#  List/Dictionary Comprehension\n\nList and dictionary comprehensions are concise ways to create new lists or dictionaries from existing iterables. The basic syntax is:\n```python\nnew_list = [expression for element in iterable]\nnew_dict = {key: value for element in iterable}\n```\nHere, `expression` is evaluated for each element in the `iterable`, and the results are collected in a new list or dictionary.\n\n# Comprehension Example:\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nsquared_numbers = [x**2 for x in numbers]\nprint(squared_numbers)  # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n```\n\n# Nested Loops\n```python\nfor i in range(3):\n    for j in range(2):\n        print(f\"i: {i}, j: {j}\")\n```\nOutput:\n```\ni: 0, j: 0\ni: 0, j: 1\ni: 1, j: 0\ni: 1, j: 1\ni: 2, j: 0\ni: 2, j: 1\n```\n\n# Recursion\nRecursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself repeatedly until a base case is reached. The basic syntax is:\n```python\ndef function(arg):\n    if base_case:\n        return result\n    else:\n        return function(arg)\n```\nHere, the function calls itself with a new argument until the base case is reached, at which point the function returns a result.\n\n# Recursion Example\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n-1)\nprint(factorial(5))  # 120\n```\n\n\n# Managing Complexity with Functions\n1. **Code Reusability**: You can write a function once and use it multiple times throughout your program, reducing code duplication.\n2. **Modularity**: Functions help organise your code into smaller, independent units that are easier to understand and maintain.\n3. **Abstraction**: Functions can hide complex logic and implementation details, making it easier to use them without worrying about the inner workings.\n\n# Function Components and Syntax\n\n1. **Function Name**: A unique name given to the function, which is used to call it.\n2. **Parameters**: Optional values that are passed to the function when it's called. Parameters are used to customise the function's behavior.\n3. **Return Statement**: An optional statement that returns a value from the function.\n4. **Function Body**: The code that's executed when the function is called.\n\n# Function example\n```python\ndef greet(name) {\n  print(f'Hello, {name}!')\n}\n\ngreet(\"John\") # Output: Hello, John!\n```\n\n# Best Practices for Writing Functions\n\n1. **Keep it Simple**: Functions should perform a single, well-defined task.\n2. **Use Meaningful Names**: Choose function names that clearly indicate what the function does.\n3. **Use Parameters**: Pass parameters to customise the function's behavior.\n4. **Return Values**: Use return statements to provide useful values to the caller.\n5. **Test Thoroughly**: Write tests to ensure your functions work correctly and handle edge cases.\n\n\n# Data Structures: Tuples, Lists, Dictionaries and Sets\n- Tuples: storing immutable values\n- Lists: Storing Sequences of Values\n- Dictionaries: Key-Value Pairs for Data Organisation\n- Sets: Storing unique values\n\n\n# Tuples: Storing Immutable Values\n\n```python\nmy_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\nprint(my_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\n# Trying to modify the tuple will raise a TypeError\nmy_tuple[0] = 10  # Raises TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n```\n# Lists: Storing Sequences of Values\n\n```python\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n# Modifying the list is allowed\nmy_list.append(6)\nprint(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\n# Dictionaries: Key-Value Pairs for Data Organisation\n\n```python\nmy_dict = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"New York\"}\nprint(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}\n\n# Accessing values using keys\nprint(my_dict[\"name\"])  # Output: John\nprint(my_dict[\"age\"])  # Output: 30\n\n# Modifying values is allowed\nmy_dict[\"age\"] = 31\nprint(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'John', 'age': 31, 'city': 'New York'}\n```\n\n# Sets: Storing Unique Values\n\n```python\nmy_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nprint(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\n# Adding a duplicate value will not change the set\nmy_set.add(5)\nprint(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\n# Removing a value is allowed\nmy_set.remove(3)\nprint(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 4, 5}\n```\n\n\n# Common List operations\n\nA List in Python is a collection of items that can be of any data type, including strings, integers, floats, and other lists. Lists are denoted by square brackets `[]` and are ordered, meaning that the order of items matters.\n\n* **Indexing**: Allows accessing specific elements using their position in the data structure. Only lists support indexing.\n* **Slicing**: Allows extracting a subset of elements from a list. Only lists support slicing.\n* **Append**: Adds new elements to the end of a list. Only lists support appending.\n* **Insert**: Inserts new elements at a specific position in a list. Only lists support inserting.\n* **Remove**: Removes elements from a list. Only lists support removing.\n\n# Examples\n* Indexing: `my_list[0]` returns the first element of the list.\n* Slicing: `my_list[1:3]` returns the elements at indices 1 and 2.\n* Append: `my_list.append(\"new element\")` adds a new element to the end of the list.\n* Insert: `my_list.insert(1, \"new element\")` inserts a new element at index 1.\n* Remove: `my_list.remove(\"old element\")` removes the first occurrence of the element \"old element\" from the list.\n\n`Note that tuples, dictionaries, and sets do not support these operations. Tuples are immutable, dictionaries are key-value pairs, and sets are unordered collections of unique elements.`\n\n# Modules and Packages\n- Functions: Group of statement\n- Class: Group of functions and data\n- Modules: Grouping Functions (or classes)\n- Packages: Collections of Modules\n\n# Problem Solving Framework\n- Understand the problem\n- Identify input/output\n- Work the problem by hand (early test cases)\n- Write pseudo code and convert to python\n- Test with variety of data\n\n# **Understand the Problem**\n- Read and re-read the problem statement to ensure you understand what is being asked.\n- Identify the key elements of the problem, including:\n    - Inputs: What data will the program need to solve the problem?\n    - Outputs: What results should the program produce?\n    - Constraints: Are there any limitations or rules that the program must follow?\n\n#  **Identify Input/Output**\n- Determine the types and formats of the input data.\n- Identify the expected output format and any specific requirements (e.g., precision, formatting).\n\n#  **Work the Problem by Hand (Early Test Cases)**\n- Choose a few simple test cases to work through by hand.\n- Verify that your manual calculations produce the expected output.\n  - This step helps you understand the problem better and identify any potential issues.\n\n#  **Write Pseudo Code and Convert to Python**\n- Write pseudo code to describe the steps your program will take to solve the problem.\n- Convert the pseudo code to Python, using a top-down approach to structure your code.\n- Focus on one component at a time, and make sure each part is working correctly before moving on to the next.\n\n# **Test with Variety of Data**\n- Write test cases to verify that your program produces the expected output for a variety of input data.\n- Use a range of inputs, including edge cases and unusual data, to ensure your program is robust and reliable.\n- Test your program in different environments and configurations to ensure it works as expected.\n\n\n# **Step 1 - Understand the Problem**\n\nLet's go through each step to develop a simple program to convert temperature from Kelvin to Celsius.\n\n- Define the Problem: Kelvin to Celsius Conversion\n\nThe problem is to write a program that takes a temperature in Kelvin as input and returns the equivalent temperature in Celsius.  This is simple, but in real life probably interview the client, do some independent research, chat to experts, read research papers, study existing programs etc.\n\n# **Step 2 - Define Inputs and Outputs**\n\n- Input: Kelvin Temperature (a single number, e.g., 273.15)\n- Output: Celsius Temperature (a single number, e.g., 0.15)\n\n# **Step 3 - Work the Problem by Hand**\n\n> Let's convert 273.15 Kelvin to Celsius. We know that the conversion formula is:\n>\n> Celsius = Kelvin - 273.15\n>\n> So, we subtract 273.15 from 273.15 to get:\n> \n> Celsius = 0.15\n\nThis manual calculation shows that the program should subtract 273.15 from the input Kelvin temperature to get the equivalent Celsius temperature.\n\n# **Step 4 - Write Pseudo Code**\n\nThis pseudo code defines the algorithm for the conversion. It takes the input Kelvin temperature, subtracts 273.15, and prints the result.\n\n```\ninput_kelvin = get kelvin temperature\ncelsius = input_kelvin - 273.15\nprint celsius\n```\n\n```python\ninput_kelvin = input(\"Please input temperature in Kelvin\")\ncelsius = input_kelvin - 273.15\nprint(celsius)\n```\n\n\n# **Step 5 - Test with Data**\n\n- Test Cases: Valid and Invalid Inputs\n- Valid Inputs:\n    - 273.15 Kelvin -> 0.15 Celsius\n    - 0 Kelvin -> -273.15 Celsius\n  - 500 Kelvin -> 226.85 Celsius\n- Invalid Inputs:\n    - Negative Kelvin (e.g., -273.15) -> Error handling needed\n    - Non-numeric input (e.g., \"abc\") -> Error handling needed\n- Handling Edge Cases (Negative Kelvin):\n  - We'll add error handling to handle negative Kelvin inputs. For example, we could print an error message and return an error code.\n\n\n# Final Python program:\n```python\ndef kelvin_to_celsius(kelvin):\n    if kelvin < 0:\n        print(\"Error: Negative Kelvin temperature\")\n        return None\n    celsius = kelvin - 273.15\n    return celsius\n\n# Test cases\nprint(kelvin_to_celsius(273.15))  # 0.15\nprint(kelvin_to_celsius(0))  # -273.15\nprint(kelvin_to_celsius(500))  # 226.85\n\n# Invalid inputs\nprint(kelvin_to_celsius(-273.15))  # Error: Negative Kelvin temperature\nprint(kelvin_to_celsius(\"abc\"))  # Error: Non-numeric input\n```\n\n# Using Jupyter Notebooks for Prototyping\n- Rapid Prototyping\n- Interactive Development Environment\n- Collaboration\n- Data Exploration\n- Immediate feedback\n- Reproducible\n\n\n::: {.notes}\n\n**Benefits of Jupyter Notebooks:**\n\n1. **Rapid Prototyping**: Jupyter Notebooks allow you to quickly write and execute code, making it an ideal tool for rapid prototyping.

GUIs are designed to be more intuitive and user-friendly than command-line interfaces.\n\nTkinter is a Python binding to the Tk GUI toolkit. It is the standard Python interface to Tk and is bundled with most standard Python distributions.\n\n# Basics of Graphical User Interfaces**\n\n- **Widgets**: A widget is a basic building block of a GUI. Examples of widgets include buttons, labels, text boxes, and menus.\n- **Layout**: The layout of a GUI refers to the arrangement of widgets on the screen. This can be done using various layout managers such as grid, pack, and place.\n- **Events**: Events are actions that occur when a user interacts with a GUI, such as clicking a button or typing in a text box. GUIs use event handlers to respond to these events.\n\n# GUI Example**\n\n```python\nimport tkinter as tk\n\ndef create_widgets(master):\n    # Button to display \"Hello World\" and print a message on click\n    hi_there = tk.Button(master, text=\"Hello World\\n(click me)\", command=say_hi)\n    hi_there.pack(side=\"top\")\n    \n    # Button to quit the application\n    quit_button = tk.Button(master, text=\"QUIT\", fg=\"red\", command=master.destroy)\n    quit_button.pack(side=\"bottom\")\n\ndef say_hi():\n    print(\"hi there, everyone!\")\n\n# Create the main window\nroot = tk.Tk()\n\n# Call the function to create widgets\ncreate_widgets(root)\n\n# Start the main event loop\nroot.mainloop()\n```\n\n# GUI Tips\n\n- Always use a consistent layout and design for your GUI.\n- Use meaningful and descriptive names for your widgets and variables.\n- Handle events and errors properly.\n- Use a GUI builder or IDE to simplify the process of building GUIs.\n\n\n# Conclusion - Recap of Learning Points\n\n- **Data Representation and Types** Computers store and interpret data as binary sequences (0s and 1s), with data types defining how these sequences are understood and manipulated (e.g., as numbers, text, or multimedia).\n- **Six Fundamental Operations:** Mastering these operations provides the foundation for all programming tasks, enabling you to gather, process, and present data effectively.\n- **Problem-Solving Framework:** This structured approach helps break down complex problems into manageable steps, ensuring a systematic and thorough solution.\n\nUnderstanding data representation and types is fundamental to all aspects of programming.

These binary sequences form the basis for all types of data a computer can handle. The concept of data types is crucial because it tells the computer how to interpret these binary sequences, whether as numbers, text, images, sound, or more complex structures like documents and videos. Here's a deeper look at how data representation and types are foundational and their relationship to the six fundamental operations and the problem-solving framework:\n\n#### How Data Representation and Types Relate to the Six Fundamental Operations:\n\n1. **Input:**\n   - **Relevance:** When inputting data into a program, knowing the data type is essential for correctly interpreting and processing the input. For instance, user inputs are often strings that may need conversion to other types (e.g., integers or floats) for calculations.\n   - **Example:** Reading a temperature input as a string and converting it to a float for further processing.\n\n2. **Output:**\n   - **Relevance:** When outputting data, the format and type must be considered to ensure the information is presented correctly. Different data types may require different formatting techniques.\n   - **Example:** Displaying a temperature value with appropriate units (°C or °F) and ensuring it's correctly formatted as a number.\n\n3. **Calculation:**\n   - **Relevance:** Calculations require an understanding of numeric data types (integers, floats) to perform arithmetic operations accurately.\n   - **Example:** Converting temperatures between different scales involves arithmetic operations on float values.\n\n4. **Store/Assignment:**\n   - **Relevance:** Storing data in variables requires assigning appropriate types to ensure correct manipulation and retrieval. Data types dictate the operations that can be performed on the stored data.\n   - **Example:** Assigning a temperature reading to a float variable and later updating it based on new input.\n\n5. **Make Decisions (If/Then):**\n   - **Relevance:** Decision-making relies on Boolean expressions that often compare values of specific types. The result of these comparisons dictates the program’s flow.\n   - **Example:** Checking if a temperature value exceeds a certain threshold to determine whether it's hot or cold.\n\n6. **Going Loopy (for, while):**\n   - **Relevance:** Iterating over collections of data (like lists or arrays) requires understanding the data type of elements being processed to apply appropriate operations.\n   - **Example:** Looping through a list of temperature readings to find the highest value.\n\n#### How Data Representation and Types Relate to the Problem-Solving Framework:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - **Importance:** Identifying the types of data involved is crucial for defining the problem accurately. This step sets the stage for deciding how data will be handled throughout the solution.\n   - **Example:** Recognising that temperatures need to be processed as floats for accurate conversion between scales.\n\n2. **Define Inputs and Outputs:**\n   - **Importance:** Clearly defining data types for inputs and outputs ensures that the solution will handle data correctly and predictably.\n   - **Example:** Specifying that input temperatures will be floats and output temperatures will be formatted strings.\n\n3. **Work the Problem by Hand:**\n   - **Importance:** Manually solving the problem with known data types helps in understanding the operations required and ensures the logical correctness of the approach.\n   - **Example:** Manually converting a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius, noting the arithmetic operations involved.\n\n4. **Write Pseudo Code:**\n   - **Importance:** Pseudo code helps in abstracting the problem and specifying data types without worrying about syntax, ensuring the logical flow is sound.\n   - **Example:** Outlining steps for temperature conversion, including type conversion operations.\n\n5. **Convert to Python Code:**\n   - **Importance:** Translating pseudo code to Python involves explicitly defining and using data types correctly to implement the solution.\n   - **Example:** Implementing the conversion algorithm with correct type handling in Python.\n\n6. **Test with Data:**\n   - **Importance:** Testing the program with various data types ensures that all edge cases and typical scenarios are handled correctly, confirming the robustness of the solution.\n   - **Example:** Testing the temperature conversion function with a range of input values, ensuring accurate outputs.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nUnderstanding data representation and types is fundamental to all aspects of programming. It underpins how input is processed, calculations are performed, decisions are made, and output is generated. Mastery of data types ensures that solutions are robust, efficient, and correct, seamlessly integrating with the six fundamental operations and the structured problem-solving framework.\n\nBy understanding and applying, data representation, the six fundamental operations and the problem-solving framework, you are equipped with the essential tools to tackle a wide range of programming challenges.
