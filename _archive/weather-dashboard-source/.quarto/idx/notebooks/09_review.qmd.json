Answer the questions in the provided code cells.\n\n\n\n\n### 1. Python Basics\nWrite a Python program that prints \"Hello, World!\".\n\n```{python}\n# Put your answer here\n```\n\n### 2. Variables and Data Types\nDefine a variable `temperature` and assign it a value of 25.5. Print the temperature.\n\n```{python}\n# Put your answer here\n```\n\n\n\n### 3. Input and Output\nPrompt the user to enter today's temperature in Celsius using `input()`. Convert the input to a float and print it.\n\n```{python}\n# Put your answer here\n```\n\n\n\n### 4. Conditional Statements\nWrite a program that checks if a temperature (`temp`) is above 30°C and prints \"It's a hot day!\" if true, otherwise print \"Enjoy the weather!\".\n\n```{python}\n# Put your answer here\n```\n\n\n### 5. Loops\nUse a loop to print temperatures from 20°C to 25°C.\n\n```{python}\n# Put your answer here\n```\n\n\n## Section 2: Data Handling with pandas and NumPy\n\n### 6. Data Handling\nCreate a pandas DataFrame with columns: `Date` and `Temperature`. Add rows for three days with temperatures: [25.5, 28.0, 30.5]. Display the DataFrame.\n\n```{python}\n# Put your answer here\n```\n\n\n### 7. Data Manipulation\nCalculate the average temperature from the DataFrame created in question 6 using pandas.\n\n```{python}\n# Put your answer here\n```\n\n\n### 8. Array Operations\nUse NumPy to create an array `temperatures` with values [23.0, 24.5, 26.0, 27.5]. Print the maximum temperature from this array.\n\n```{python}\n# Put your answer here\n```\n\n\n### 9. DataFrame Filtering\nFilter the DataFrame from question 6 to show days where the temperature was above 28°C.\n\n```{python}\n# Put your answer here\n```\n\n\n## Section 3: Visualization with Matplotlib\n\n### 10. Simple Plotting\nPlot the temperatures from question 8 using Matplotlib. Label the x-axis as \"Day\" and y-axis as \"Temperature (°C)\".\n\n```{python}\n# Put your answer here\n```\n\n\n### 11. Customization\nEnhance the plot from question 10 with a title \"Weekly Temperature Variation\" and grid lines.\n\n```{python}\n# Put your answer here\n```\n\n\n### 12. Multiple Plots\nCreate a subplot with two plots: one for temperatures from question 6 and another for temperatures from question 8.\n\n```{python}\n# Put your answer here\n```\n\n\n## Section 4: GUI Development with tkinter\n\n### 13. Basic GUI\nCreate a tkinter GUI window that displays a label showing today's temperature.\n\n```{python}\n# Put your answer here\n```\n\n\n### 14. Input and Buttons\nDesign a GUI where users can input a temperature in Celsius, convert it to Fahrenheit, and display the result when clicking a button.\n\n```{python}\n# Put your answer here\n```\n\n\n## Section 5: Advanced Applications\n\n### 15. API Integration\nUse a Python library to fetch real-time weather data (temperature, humidity) from an online API and display it.\n\n```{python}\n# Put your answer here\n```\n\n\n### 16. File Handling\nWrite a Python program that reads temperature data from a CSV file and calculates the average temperature.\n\n```{python}\n# Put your answer here\n```\n\n\n### 17. Error Handling\nImplement error handling in a program that prompts the user for a temperature input. Ensure the program handles non-numeric inputs gracefully.\n\n```{python}\n# Put your answer here\n```\n\n\n## Section 6: Project Integration with GitHub and JupyterLab\n\n### 18. Version Control\nDescribe how GitHub can be used for version control in a programming project like building a weather dashboard.\n\n```{python}\n# Put your answer here\n```\n\n\n### 19. Documentation\nExplain the importance of documentation in programming projects. How would you use JupyterLab and markdown cells for documentation?\n\n```{python}\n# Put your answer here\n```\n\n\n### 20. Collaboration\nDiscuss how multiple developers can collaborate on a Python project using GitHub, focusing on branch management and pull requests.\n\n```{python}\n# Put your answer here\n```\n\n\n## Section 7: Review and Synthesis\n\n### 21. Problem-Solving Framework\nUse the 5-step problem-solving framework (understand, inputs/outputs, work by hand, pseudo code, test) to outline a program that converts Fahrenheit to Celsius.\n\n```{python}\n# Put your answer here\n```\n\n\n\n### 22. Integration of Concepts\nDevelop a program that reads weather data from a CSV file, filters temperatures above 25°C, and plots the results using Matplotlib.\n\n```{python}\n# Put your answer here\n```\n\n\n### 23. Complex GUI Design\nDesign a tkinter-based GUI for a weather dashboard that displays current weather conditions (temperature, humidity) using data fetched from an API.\n\n```{python}\n# Put your answer here\n```\n\n\n\n\n### 24. Data Analysis\nAnalyze temperature data collected over a week, calculate the average temperature, and visualize daily fluctuations using pandas and Matplotlib.\n\n```{python}\n# Put your answer here\n```\n\n\n\n## Section 8: Advanced Challenges\n\n### 25. Data Interpolation\nImplement a program that interpolates missing temperature data points in a time series dataset using NumPy or pandas.\n\n```{python}\n# Put your answer here\n```\n\n\n### 26. Statistical Analysis\nConduct statistical analysis on temperature data collected over a month, including mean, median, and standard deviation calculations.\n\n```{python}\n# Put your answer here\n```\n\n\n\n\n### 27. Dynamic Visualization\nCreate a dynamic visualization using Matplotlib that updates in real-time as new temperature data is fetched from an API.\n\n\n```{python}\n# Put your answer here\n```\n\n### 28. Error Analysis\nDevelop a program that analyzes temperature data for outliers (extreme values) and suggests corrective actions based on statistical analysis.\n\n```{python}\n# Put your answer here\n```\n\n\n### 29. Project Integration\nIntegrate all concepts learned into a comprehensive weather dashboard project using Python, pandas, Matplotlib, tkinter, and GitHub for version control and collaboration.\n\n```{python}\n# Put your answer here\n```\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\nThis worksheet will guide you through various programming concepts using Python, focusing on temperature and weather themes.
