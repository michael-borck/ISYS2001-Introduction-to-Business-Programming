Through interactive sessions, students will learn to fetch, process, and visualise weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. They will also work with pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib for plotting, Jupyter Widgets for interactive dashboards, and basic testing to ensure code reliability. This project strengthens procedural programming skills and demonstrates practical uses of Python in real-world scenarios.\n\n## Partnership Between Curtin University and South China Normal University\n\nThe WeatherVista project is a joint initiative by Curtin University and South China Normal University, offering a rich learning environment for students in China. Instructors from Curtin University conduct live sessions tailored to the students' needs, addressing language barriers and ensuring clear communication of concepts. This collaboration enhances education, promotes international cooperation, cultural exchange, and a shared commitment to advancing technical education.\n\n## Simplified Approach\n\nThe simplified WeatherVista project introduces essential programming and data management concepts clearly and accessibly. By focusing on simple implementations and practical examples, we make learning easier. Instead of advanced testing frameworks or comprehensive documentation, we use basic tests and docstrings, allowing students to access documentation directly in their code with Python's `help()` function. Each session builds on the previous one, reinforcing key concepts through hands-on activities, live coding, and discussions. This approach ensures students effectively learn and apply their skills, laying a solid foundation for further development. Brainstorming sessions for project extensions encourage creativity and practical application of learned skills.\n\n\n## Sessions Overview\n\n1. **Introduction to the Project and Setting Up the Environment**\n2. **Fetching Data from OpenWeatherMap API**\n3. **Data Management with CSV**\n4. **Basic Data Visualisation with Matplotlib**\n5. **Advanced Data Visualisation and Dashboard Layout**\n6. **Web Scraping and Using APIs (Optional)**\n7. **Building the Dashboard with Jupyter Widgets**\n8. **Basic Testing**\n9. **Finalising the Project and Basic Distribution**\n10. **Final Project Review and Brainstorming Extensions**\n\n### Session Breakdown\n\n#### Session 1: Introduction to the Project and Setting Up the Environment\n- **Overview:**\n  -
