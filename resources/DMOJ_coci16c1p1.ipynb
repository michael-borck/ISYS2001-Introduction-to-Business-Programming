        "Pero has a data plan with his cell phone provider that offers him x megabytes of data per month. In addition, any data he doesn’t use in a given month carries over to the next month. For example, if x is 10 and Pero uses only 4MB in a given month, the remaining 6MB carry over to the next month (in which he’d now have 10 + 6 = 16MB available).\n",

        "* A line containing integer n, the number of months that Pero has had the data plan. n is between 1 and 100.\n",
        "* n lines, one for each month, giving the integer number of megabytes that Pero uses in that month. Each number is at least 0 and will never outstrip the number of available megabytes. (For example, if x is 10 and Pero currently has 30MB available, the next number will be at most 30.)\n",

He uses 1MB this month, so the excess that carries forward is 14 – 1 = 13MB.We need to know the number of megabytes that Pero has available for the next (that is, fourth) month. He has 13MB that carry over from the first three months, and he’s given his usual 10MB for this month, so he has a total of 13 + 10 = 23MB to use.\n"

For that reason, we don’t use the value of i anywhere in the program. You can replace i with _ (an underscore) to be explicit about the variable’s “don’t care” status, but I’ll leave it as i for consistency with other examples.\n",

Even if you’ve succeeded in solving a problem, you might like to Google the problem to learn from how others have solved it. In ad- dition, some online judges, like DMOJ, allow you to view other people’s sub- missions once you’ve solved the problem. For submissions that pass all of the test cases: did those programmers do things differently from you? For submissions that fail some test cases: what’s wrong with the code? Reading other people’s code is a great way to improve your own programming skill!\n",

They might read an explanation or code and not be able to make sense of it. This doesn’t mean that they are not smart enough. It just means they need a different presentation, one that aligns more closely to your current thinking. You might also flag difficult explanations and examples for later review. They may prove to be surprisingly useful once you’ve gained further practice.**"
