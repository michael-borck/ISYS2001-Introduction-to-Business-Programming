        "Debugging is the process of figuring out what is going wrong with your code.There are many ways to debug. This notebook will talk about one specific way: print statement debugging. Print statement debugging is great for beginners because it doesn't require special tools. It's a great way to develop a sense of how to debug effectively.\n",

Then run the program and look at the output.  If you see the numbers “1” “2” “3” “4” and so on then the program is execusitng as expeted. If a number is missing then you can investigate further to see whay.\n",
