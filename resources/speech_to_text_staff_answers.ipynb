        "The 'missing' link or common question is how do I know to use this package. If time allows, I demonstrate by googling the problem and then decide to use the package based on my reading of the pages, trust/faith in the webpage source, etc. I try to demonstrate the process of finding information to solve my problem (or learning how to learn).\n",

        "\n",
        "This notebook also uses file io. We need an audio file source. We could download, upload to Colab. The 'upload' can get a little complex as we need to understand google drive, mounting the drive, paths to folders etc. For now, the easier option is to use wget, and it will download the audio file the location of the notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "To process the audio file, we use **with** statement. The **with** statement is used in the exception handline to make the code cleaner. See [with statement in Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/with-statement-in-python/) for more details.\n",

        "It might be worth mentioning the issues of 'large' audio files and perhaps discussing our initial approach to use a small file, getting the process working, and then considering a bigger file (this is out the test with other data steps).\n"
