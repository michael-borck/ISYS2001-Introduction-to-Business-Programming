## Executive Summary

Contemporary programming practices have shifted toward AI orchestration, low-code platforms, and visual development environments. This proposal redesigns ISYS2001/ISYS5002 to align with current industry practices while maintaining academic standards.

The redesigned curriculum transforms the unit from AI-assisted Python syntax instruction to comprehensive computational thinking using low-code and AI-powered tools. The 12-week program enables students to develop practical business solutions through visual programming, automation, data analysis, and AI collaboration, while maintaining full compliance with programming education requirements for accreditation.

This structure provides foundational preparation for undergraduate pathways (ISYS3004 Web Technologies, ISYS3015 Application Development) and postgraduate AI streams (ISYS6014 Governance, ISYS6019 Application), ensuring curriculum coherence across programs.

The emphasis on problem decomposition and system design creates transferable skills for database design, systems analysis, and capstone projects. Students develop practical methodologies for business problem-solving, with particular benefit for rapid prototyping in advanced units.

By removing syntax barriers and focusing on computational thinking, the unit becomes accessible to non-technical students across Business, creating opportunities for service teaching and micro-credentials. This positions ISYS2001 as a cornerstone for digital literacy education throughout the institution.

## Purpose of Redesign

Modern business programming increasingly involves AI system prompting, low-code workflow construction, and intelligent automation design. This redesign aligns ISYS2001 with industry practices while maintaining focus on computational thinking and logic over syntax memorisation.

The proposed 12-week schedule emphasises computational thinking, AI literacy, and low-code platforms while satisfying all existing Unit Learning Outcomes (ULOs). This approach reflects business information systems practice, where IS professionals and business analysts utilise AI assistants, visual workflows, and automation platforms. The redesign also improves accessibility for non-technical students by removing syntax barriers.

### Key Principles

1. **Tool Diversity**: Exposure to 10+ programming paradigms and platforms
2. **Progressive Complexity**: Sequential concept building with incremental tool introduction
3. **Business Relevance**: Direct application to business scenarios
4. **AI Integration**: AI as collaborative development tool
5. **Portfolio Development**: Creation of demonstrable skillset

---

## Unit Title Rationale

The unit title "Introduction to Business Programming" remains accurate and appropriate for this redesigned curriculum. Programming in contemporary business contexts has evolved beyond writing code to encompass visual development, workflow automation, and AI orchestration.

Business professionals today "program" by configuring n8n workflows, designing Voiceflow conversations, and building Observable dashboards—activities that require the same computational thinking, logic design, and systematic problem-solving as traditional coding. Major technology companies now recognise low-code/no-code platforms as legitimate programming environments. This curriculum teaches programming as it is actually practiced by business analysts and information system professionals, not software engineers: through tool orchestration, system integration, and AI collaboration.

Students still learn fundamental programming concepts—variables, control structures, data types, algorithms—but through contemporary platforms that enable immediate business value. The unit thus fulfills accreditation requirements for programming education while preparing students for the reality of how business solutions are built today.

## Alignment with Unit Learning Outcomes (ULOs)

The redesign satisfies existing ULOs through contemporary approaches:
