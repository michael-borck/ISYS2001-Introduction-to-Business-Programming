## Purpose of Redesign

This redesign proposes a modernised 12-week schedule for ISYS2001 that foregrounds computational thinking, AI fluency, and low-code toolchains while meeting all existing **Unit Learning Outcomes (ULOs)** and syllabus requirements. Syntax memorisation is deprioritised in favour of planning, logic, and problem decomposition using AI and visual tools.

### Unit Summary (as it stands)
The syllabus and ULOs emphasize:

- Basic programming using Python
- IDE use and debugging
- Data types, control structures, and algorithm
- Testing strategies and optimisation
- Real-world problem-solving with social/ethical awareness
- Project-based, AI-enhanced learning (already embedded)


## Alignment with Unit Learning Outcomes (ULOs)

The ULOs don’t mandate syntax-first teaching. They require students to:

- Use an IDE,
- Recognise and use programming constructs,
- Plan and test,
- Solve problems responsibly with code.


| ULO | Description                                                                 | Redesign Alignment                                                                                                                            |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Configure and navigate an IDE to develop, debug, and execute programs       | Students use modern low-code environments (Scratch, Orange, n8n, App Inventor, Replit AI) and optionally Python (Thonny/Colab) in later weeks |
| 2   | Recognise, describe, and use data types and algorithmic constructs          | Delivered through visual workflows (Orange, Scratch), game logic (Pico-8), and dashboards (Observable), culminating in a final project        |
| 3   | Plan and execute testing strategies; refine and optimise programs           | Reflection on AI/tool outputs, testing chatbot workflows, debugging n8n and code logic in Weeks 5, 9, 11                                      |
| 4   | Develop problem-solving strategies to solve real-world problems responsibly | Emphasised through scenario-based labs (business automation, customer support, ethical prompt use), and the capstone project                  |
