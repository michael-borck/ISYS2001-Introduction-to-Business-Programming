        "Understanding different programming paradigms is crucial not only for developing flexible coding skills but also for appreciating how these paradigms can be applied to solve various problems efficiently. This worksheet will guide you through the foundational concepts of Procedural and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, helping you see where each approach might be most effective.\n",
