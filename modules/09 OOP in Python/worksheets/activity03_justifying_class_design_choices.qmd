# Mastering OOP: Design Choices Unpacked
*Explore and Justify Object-Oriented Programming Decisions*

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this activity, you will be able to:
- Understand and apply basic principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
- Justify the design choices made when creating class structures in Python.
- Evaluate and improve your design approach using AI tools responsibly.

## Introduction
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a crucial paradigm in software development, known for its ability to encapsulate data and functions into structures known as classes. This approach not only enhances code modularity and reusability but also simplifies complex software designs. As budding software developers, understanding how to design and justify your class structures will be essential in your programming career.

## Using AI Tools Ethically & Effectively
> **Transparency:** Always disclose when and how you have used AI assistance in your work. It's important to be open about the tools you use and how they contribute to your outcomes.
>
> **Critical Evaluation:** Remember, AI is a tool—not a replacement for your judgement. Always review and critically assess the AI-generated content before including it in your work.
>
> **Learning Partner:** Use AI to deepen your understanding. Ask it to explain concepts or provide examples, but ensure you're still engaging deeply with the material and not just copying answers.

## Key Concepts
- **Class:** A blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure).
- **Inheritance:** A mechanism for creating a new class using details of an existing class without modifying it.
- **Polymorphism:** The ability to redefine methods for derived classes.
- **Encapsulation:** Keeping the data inside a class safe from external modification.

## Application Activities

### Activity 1: Designing a Simple Class
Imagine you need to create a software system for a library to manage books and patrons. Design a class `Book` that includes attributes like title, author, and year of publication, and methods for checking in and checking out the book.

*Your response:*
```{python}
# Write your class definition here.
```

💡 **AI Tip**: Stuck on attributes? Ask an AI: "What are common attributes of books in a library system?" Use the suggestions to refine your class design.

### Activity 2: Justifying Your Design
Write a short paragraph explaining why you designed the `Book` class as you did. What benefits does your design offer? How does it adhere to OOP principles such as encapsulation and polymorphism?

*Your response:*
```
# Provide your justification here.
```

💡 **AI Tip**: Drafted your answer? Ask an AI: "Review this explanation for clarity and suggest improvements." Use its feedback to refine your own writing.

## Extension Challenge
Design a `Patron` class for the library system that interacts with your `Book` class. Consider methods like `borrow_book` and `return_book`. How might these classes interact to manage state changes like a book being checked out?

*Your response:*
```{python}
# Write your extended class definition here.
```

## Reflection
Reflect on how you used AI tools to assist with your class design. What did you find most helpful? How did you ensure the integrity of your work when using AI suggestions?

*Your reflection:*
```
# Your reflection here.
```

Remember, the key to leveraging AI effectively is to use it as a tool to enhance your learning, not to replace it. Always aim to understand deeply and think critically about the solutions you develop.
