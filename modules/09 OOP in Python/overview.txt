# Business Web and Mobile Technologies - Week 8: Object Oriented Programming in Python

## 🎯 This Week's Focus
- Analyse the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to understand class structures.
- Evaluate different OOP approaches for their effectiveness in simplifying complex software solutions.
- Apply OOP concepts to enhance the modularity of Python code.
- Justify the use of inheritance and polymorphism in designing reusable code.
- Critique existing procedural code and refactor it to an object-oriented format.
- Design and implement classes that encapsulate both data and methods appropriately.

## 📖 Before the Lab
- Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming
- Understanding Classes and Objects in Python
- Deep Dive: Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Refactoring Procedural Code to Object-Oriented Code

## 📝 Assessment
- Self-Assessment Quiz on OOP Concepts
- Peer Review: Evaluate Class Designs
- Short Analysis Task: Critiquing OOP Implementations in Python

## 🛠 Workshop Activities
- Implementing Your First Python Class (Skill focus: Applying concepts)
- Comparing Procedural vs Object-Oriented Code in Python (Skill focus: Analysing trade-offs)
- Justifying Class Design Choices (Skill focus: Justifying methodology)

## 🚀 Projects Area
This week, students will undertake the project of refactoring their ongoing Weather Dashboard project into a class-based structure using Python. This project will not only test their understanding of OOP principles but also challenge them to analyse and justify their design and architectural decisions.
- Project Title: Refactoring Weather Dashboard to OOP
