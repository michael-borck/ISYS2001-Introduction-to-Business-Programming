MC	How does polymorphism enhance flexibility in software design?	By keeping the code private	incorrect	By allowing the same function to work with different objects	correct	By enabling classes to inherit features only from their parent class	incorrect	By allowing classes to use only their own methods	incorrect
MC	What is a class in OOP?	A specific instance of an object	incorrect	A template for creating objects	correct	A type of function	incorrect	A memory allocation method	incorrect
MC	How does OOP differ from procedural programming?	OOP is function-centric, while procedural is data-centric	incorrect	OOP organises software design around data and methods, while procedural focuses on sequences of procedures	correct	OOP uses only global variables, while procedural uses encapsulation	incorrect	There is no significant difference; both paradigms are essentially the same.	incorrect
MC	Which of the following best describes polymorphism in OOP?	The ability of different classes to respond to the same method call in their specific way	correct	The practice of securing the data within an object	incorrect	The process of inheriting properties from a base class	incorrect	The method of organising code into sequential steps	incorrect
MC	In the context of refactoring, what does maintaining the "external behaviour" of the code mean?	Changing the functionality to improve performance	incorrect	Enhancing the user interface without altering the backend	incorrect	Modifying the code without changing its functionality	correct	Reducing the number of functions in the code	incorrect
MC	Which of the following is not a core concept of OOP?	Encapsulation	incorrect	Inheritance	incorrect	Polymorphism	incorrect	Concurrency	correct
MC	What is the role of a superclass in inheritance?	It is a subclass that inherits properties from another subclass	incorrect	It provides properties and methods to derived classes	correct	It serves as a template for creating methods only	incorrect	It encapsulates data away from the subclass	incorrect
MC	What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) primarily centered around?	Functions	incorrect	Objects	correct	Procedures	incorrect	Variables	incorrect
MC	What does encapsulation in OOP achieve by hiding an object’s internal state?	Increases processing speed	incorrect	Enhances user interaction	incorrect	Protects data integrity	correct	Simplifies the code syntax	incorrect
MC	How does inheritance primarily contribute to software development in OOP?	By adding more methods to existing classes	incorrect	By enabling classes to share interfaces	incorrect	By reducing code redundancy and enhancing reusability	correct	By encapsulating methods within objects	incorrect
MC	Which of the following best describes polymorphism in OOP?	The ability to process objects differently based on their data type or class	correct	The process of encapsulating data and methods within a single unit	incorrect	A programming style that focuses solely on data structures	incorrect	The technique of writing code in a procedural manner	incorrect
MC	What is the primary difference between a class and an object in OOP?	An object is a blueprint, while a class is an instance	incorrect	A class is a blueprint, while an object is an instance	correct	An object allocates memory when a class is defined	incorrect	A class uses more memory than an object	incorrect
MC	Which OOP principle allows different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass?	Encapsulation	incorrect	Inheritance	incorrect	Polymorphism	correct	Abstraction	incorrect
MC	Why is Object-Oriented Programming considered crucial in modern software development?	It primarily enhances the speed of execution	incorrect	It simplifies debugging and testing	incorrect	It helps organise and manage complex software designs	correct	It reduces the need for additional memory resources	incorrect
MC	What practical example illustrates the use of polymorphism?	A 'Shape' class where subclasses like 'Circle' and 'Square' have their own 'draw()' methods	correct	A 'Vehicle' class with a single method 'drive()' implemented the same in all subclasses	incorrect	A program where each class has completely unique methods without any common interface	incorrect	An application that uses procedural programming to manage user interactions	incorrect
MC	Which principle of OOP is demonstrated by allowing a 'SavingsAccount' class to inherit from an 'Account' class?	Encapsulation	incorrect	Polymorphism	incorrect	Inheritance	correct	Composition	incorrect
MC	How do inheritance and polymorphism improve the process of refactoring procedural code to OOP?	By facilitating the creation of entirely new code structures unrelated to the original	incorrect	By enabling more procedural functions to be added	incorrect	By allowing specialised classes to reduce code duplication and implement flexible methods	correct	By discouraging the use of classes and objects	incorrect
