# Introduction to Business Programming - Week 12: Testing & Debugging

## 🎯 This Week's Focus
- Analyse various testing methodologies to identify the most suitable approach for different programming scenarios.
- Evaluate debugging tools within IDEs like Google Colab to determine their effectiveness in real-world applications.
- Apply unit testing principles using Python's unittest or pytest frameworks to basic code segments.
- Justify the use of systematic testing strategies to ensure the robustness of software applications.
- Design comprehensive test cases that simulate user interaction with the Weather Dashboard.
- Critique existing test cases for improvement and enhanced coverage.

## 📖 Before the Lab
- Module 1: Introduction to Testing Frameworks in Python
- Module 2: Advanced Debugging Techniques
- Module 3: Designing Effective Test Cases
- Module 4: Test-Driven Development (TDD) Principles

## 📝 Assessment
