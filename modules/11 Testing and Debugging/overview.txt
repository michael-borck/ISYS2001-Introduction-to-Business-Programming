# Introduction to Business Programming - Week 12: Testing & Debugging

## 🎯 This Week's Focus
- Analyse various testing methodologies (**`doctest` for integrated examples, principles of `unittest`/`pytest`**) to identify suitable approaches for different programming scenarios, considering AI's role in test generation and execution.
- Evaluate debugging tools and techniques, from fundamental `print` statements to IDE debuggers, and understand how AI can assist in error analysis and hypothesis generation.
- Apply **`doctest`** principles to create clear, executable examples and tests for Python functions.
- Justify the use of systematic testing and debugging strategies to ensure the robustness of software, especially when integrating AI-generated or AI-modified code.
- Design comprehensive `doctest` examples and conceptual test cases that simulate user interaction with the Weather Dashboard, using AI for scenario brainstorming.
- Critique existing test examples and debugging approaches for improvement, enhanced coverage, and effective AI collaboration.
