## Part 1: Enhanced Expense Entry (15 minutes)

### 🔄 From One to Many

Transform your Week 2 single-expense tracker to handle multiple expenses with proper validation:

```{python}
print("=== Enhanced Finance Tracker v0.3 ===")
print("Week 3: Loop-Powered Edition")
print()

# User setup (enhanced from Week 2)
name = input("Enter your name: ")

# Add budget validation using while loop
monthly_budget = 0
while monthly_budget < 100 or monthly_budget > 10000:
    try:
        budget_input = input("Enter monthly budget ($100-$10,000): $")
        monthly_budget = float(budget_input)
        
        if monthly_budget < 100:
            print("Budget too low! Minimum $100")
        elif monthly_budget > 10000:
            print("Budget seems high! Maximum $10,000")
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter a valid number!")

print(f"\nWelcome {name}! Monthly budget: ${monthly_budget:.2f}")

# ========== MULTI-EXPENSE ENTRY ==========
expenses = []  # Store all expense amounts
descriptions = []  # Store what each expense was for
total_spent = 0

print("\n--- Enter Your Expenses ---")
print("Type 'done' when finished entering expenses")

# Your task: Complete the multi-expense entry system
# Use sentinel value pattern to collect multiple expenses
# Validate each expense amount (positive numbers only)
# Store both amount and description
# Show running total and budget percentage after each entry

while True:
    expense_input = input("\nExpense amount (or 'done'): $")
    
    if expense_input.lower() == 'done':
        break
    
    # Your validation and storage code here
    
    
print(f"\n📊 Expense entry complete: {len(expenses)} expenses, ${total_spent:.2f} total")
```

## Part 2: Basic Expense Analysis (15 minutes)

### 📈 Processing Your Transaction Data

Use loops to analyze the expenses you collected:

```{python}
# Expense Analysis Section
if len(expenses) > 0:
    print("\n📊 Expense Analysis:")
    
    # Basic statistics using loop patterns from workshops
    print(f"Total expenses: {len(expenses)}")
    print(f"Total spent: ${total_spent:.2f}")
    print(f"Average expense: ${total_spent/len(expenses):.2f}")
    print(f"Budget used: {(total_spent/monthly_budget)*100:.1f}%")
    print(f"Remaining budget: ${monthly_budget - total_spent:.2f}")
    
    # Your task: Find highest and lowest expenses
    # Use the min/max pattern from workshops
    highest_expense = 0
    lowest_expense = 0
    
    # Your min/max finding code here
    
    
    print(f"\n💰 Expense Range:")
    print(f"Highest expense: ${highest_expense:.2f}")
    print(f"Lowest expense: ${lowest_expense:.2f}")
    
    # Your task: Categorize expenses by size
    # Count how many expenses fall into each category:
    # Large (>20% of budget), Medium (5-20%), Small (<5%)
    
    large_count = 0    # > 20% of budget
    medium_count = 0   # 5-20% of budget
    small_count = 0    # < 5% of budget
    
    # Your categorization loop here
    
    
    print(f"\n📊 Expense Categories:")
    print(f"Large expenses (>20% budget): {large_count}")
    print(f"Medium expenses (5-20% budget): {medium_count}")
    print(f"Small expenses (<5% budget): {small_count}")
    
    # Your task: Provide smart feedback based on the analysis
    # Give different advice based on spending patterns
    print("\n💡 Smart Feedback:")
    
    # Your feedback logic here
    # Consider: budget percentage used, number of large expenses, etc.
    
    
else:
    print("\n📝 No expenses entered - try adding some transactions!")
```

## Part 3: Multiple Savings Goals Tracker (15 minutes)

### 🎯 Goal Management with Loops

Extend your tracker to handle multiple savings goals:

```{python}
print("\n=== Savings Goals Tracker ===")

# Goal collection
goal_names = []
goal_targets = []
goal_current = []

# Ask how many goals they want to track
num_goals = 0
while num_goals < 1 or num_goals > 5:  # Reasonable limits
    try:
        num_goals = int(input("How many savings goals? (1-5): "))
        if num_goals < 1:
            print("Must have at least 1 goal!")
        elif num_goals > 5:
            print("Maximum 5 goals for this tracker!")
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter a valid number!")

# Your task: Collect goal information using for loop
# For each goal (1 to num_goals):
#   - Get goal name
#   - Get target amount (with validation)
#   - Get current amount (with validation)
#   - Store in the three lists

print(f"\nEntering {num_goals} savings goals:")

for i in range(num_goals):
    print(f"\n--- Goal {i+1} ---")
    
    # Your goal collection code here
    
    
print(f"\n✅ Saved {len(goal_names)} goals!")
```

```{python}
# Goal Analysis and Progress Tracking
if len(goal_names) > 0:
    print("\n📊 Goals Progress Analysis:")
    
    # Your task: Analyze each goal
    # For each goal, calculate:
    #   - Progress percentage
    #   - Amount remaining
    #   - Months to completion (if saving $100/month)
    
    total_target = 0
    total_current = 0
    
    for i in range(len(goal_names)):
        # Your progress calculation here
        
        total_target += goal_targets[i]
        total_current += goal_current[i]
    
    # Overall progress summary
    overall_progress = (total_current / total_target) * 100 if total_target > 0 else 0
    total_remaining = total_target - total_current
    
    print(f"\n🎯 Overall Goals Summary:")
    print(f"Total target: ${total_target:.2f}")
    print(f"Total saved: ${total_current:.2f}")
    print(f"Overall progress: {overall_progress:.1f}%")
    print(f"Total remaining: ${total_remaining:.2f}")
    
    # Your task: Find which goal needs most attention
    # Find the goal with lowest progress percentage
    # Provide encouragement and specific advice
    
    
else:
    print("No goals to analyze!")
```

    print(f"💰 {name}'s Finance Tracker")
    if len(expenses) > 0:
        print(f"📊 Current: {len(expenses)} expenses, ${sum(expenses):.2f} spent")
    print("-"*30)
    print("1. View expense summary")
    print("2. View goals progress")
    print("3. Add new expense")
    print("4. Budget check")
    print("5. Exit")
    
    choice = input("\nChoose option (1-5): ")
    
    if choice == "1":
        # Display expense summary
        print("\n--- Expense Summary ---")
        
        # Your task: Show all expenses with numbers
        # Format: "1. $23.50 - Coffee"
        # Include total at the end
        
        
    elif choice == "2":
        # Display goals progress
        print("\n--- Goals Progress ---")
        
        # Your task: Show each goal with progress percentage
        # Format: "Goal Name: $current/$target (XX% complete)"
        
        
    elif choice == "3":
        # Add single new expense
        print("\n--- Add New Expense ---")
        
        # Your task: Add one more expense to existing lists
        # Use validation pattern, update totals, give feedback
        
        
    elif choice == "4":
        # Budget status check
        print("\n--- Budget Check ---")
        
        # Your task: Calculate and display budget status
        # Show percentage used, remaining amount, daily budget left
        # Give advice based on budget usage
        
        
    elif choice == "5":
        # Exit with summary
        running = False
        print(f"\nGoodbye {name}!")
        print(f"Final summary: {len(expenses)} expenses, ${sum(expenses) if expenses else 0:.2f} total")
        print("🚀 Your finance tracker is growing stronger each week!")
        
    else:
        print("Invalid choice! Please choose 1-5.")

print("\n=== Finance Tracker Session Complete ===")
```

## Part 5: Testing Your Enhanced Tracker (10 minutes)

### 🧪 Complete System Test

Test your loop-powered finance tracker with realistic data:

```{python}
# Test your tracker with this scenario:
test_instructions = """
🧪 TEST SCENARIO:

Setup:
- Name: Your name
- Budget: $2000

Goals (try 2 goals):
- "Emergency Fund": target $1000, current $250
- "Vacation": target $500, current $50

Expenses to enter:
- $450 for "Rent payment"
- $67.50 for "Weekly groceries"
- $89.00 for "Gas for car"
- done

Then test each menu option:
1. View expense summary (should show 3 expenses)
2. View goals progress (should show percentages)
3. Add expense: $25 for "Coffee"
4. Budget check (should show updated totals)
5. Exit

Expected final result:
- 4 expenses totaling $631.50
- 31.6% of budget used
- Emergency fund 25% complete
- Vacation fund 10% complete
"""

print(test_instructions)
print("\n⬆️ Run your enhanced tracker above with this test data!")
print("Check that all numbers match the expected results.")
