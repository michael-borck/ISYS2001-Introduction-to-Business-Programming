# Week 3 Overview

This week introduces the power of repetition through loops and collections. Students often find loops conceptually challenging, so we emphasise visualisation and pattern recognition over syntax memorisation.

## Key Learning Goals
1. Recognise when repetition is needed
2. Choose appropriate loop types
3. Work with collections (lists)
4. Debug common loop errors
5. Build their first data-driven program

# Lecture Delivery Guide

## Opening Hook: The Playlist Problem (10 minutes)

### Setup
Show students an AI-generated "music player" with excessive complexity:
- Classes and inheritance
- Database connections
- Recommendation algorithms
- API integrations

### Key Discussion Points
1. "Can you understand this code?"
2. "Could you modify it?"
3. "What does a playlist REALLY need?"
4. Core answer: Store songs, play in order, maybe skip

### Transition
"Let's learn to build this ourselves, simply and understandably."

## Conceptual Foundation (20 minutes)

### Real-World Repetition

Draw parallels students understand:

**ATM Example** (draw flowchart):
```
Start → Enter PIN → Wrong? → Try again → Too many? → Keep card
                       ↓
                    Correct → Continue
```

**Key Insight**: "The ATM doesn't have 3 separate PIN-checking sections. It has ONE that REPEATS."

### Three Patterns Introduction

Use physical demonstrations:

1. **Counted Repetition**
   - "Do 10 jumping jacks"
   - "Deal 5 cards"
   - Clear endpoint known

2. **Conditional Repetition**
   - "Keep stirring until thick"
   - "Stay in line until called"
   - Endpoint depends on condition

3. **Collection Processing**
   - "Grade each test in the stack"
   - "Wash each dish in the sink"
   - Process group of items

### Why Collections Matter

**Bad Approach** (write on board):
```python
score1 = 85
score2 = 90
score3 = 78
# ... score30?
```

**Better Approach**:
```python
scores = [85, 90, 78, ...]  # Can handle any number!
```

## Live Coding Section (20 minutes)

### While Loop Demo

Start with infinite loop (intentionally!):
```python
# WARNING: This will run forever!
count = 1
while count > 0:
    print(count)
    count = count + 1  # Gets bigger!
```

**Teaching Moment**:
- Show how to stop (Ctrl+C or Runtime → Interrupt)
- "Loops MUST have a way to end!"

Fix it together:
```python
count = 5
while count > 0:
    print(count)
    count = count - 1  # Now it ends!
```

### For Loop Introduction

Build understanding progressively:

```python
# First: see what range gives us
print(list(range(5)))        # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
print(list(range(1, 6)))     # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(list(range(0, 10, 2))) # [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]

# Then use in loop
for number in range(5):
    print(f"Number is: {number}")
```

### Lists and Indexing

**Critical Teaching Point**: Indices start at 0!

Draw on board:
```
scores = [85, 90, 78]
index:    0   1   2
```

Common confusion:
```python
scores = [85, 90, 78]
print(scores[1])  # Students expect 85, get 90!
```

## Common Student Confusions

### Issue 1: While vs For Choice

**Student Question**: "When do I use which?"

**Answer Framework**:
- Know how many times? → for with range()
- Have a collection? → for with list
- Everything else? → while

**Examples**:
```python
# Print 10 stars → for (known count)
for i in range(10):
    print("⭐")

# Get valid input → while (unknown count)
age = -1
while age < 0 or age > 120:
    age = int(input("Enter valid age: "))

# Process all students → for (collection)
for student in student_list:
    print(student)
```

### Issue 2: Off-by-One Errors

**Common Mistake**:
```python
# Student wants 1-5, writes:
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # Gets 0-4!
```

**Teaching Strategy**:
- Always show range output first
- Use descriptive variable names
- Comment the expected values

### Issue 3: Index Confusion

Draw this chart repeatedly:
```
List: ["a", "b", "c"]
Len:  3
Indices: 0, 1, 2
First: list[0]
Last:  list[2] or list[-1]
```

# Lab Management

## Hour 1 Structure

### Flowcharting (20 min)
- Provide templates
- Work in pairs
- Check understanding before coding

### Basic Patterns (20 min)
- Start with working examples
- Let students modify
- Build confidence gradually

### List Practice (20 min)
- Emphasise bounds checking
- Show error messages
- Practice safe access patterns

## Hour 2 Structure

### Integration Exercises (20 min)
- Combine concepts gradually
- Provide scaffolded code
- Focus on one new concept at a time

### Common Patterns (20 min)
- Menu systems are engaging
- Search patterns are practical
- Statistics connect to math

### Project Start (20 min)
- Get everyone started
- Core functionality only
- Save enhancements for homework

## Lab Tips

1. **Circulate Constantly** - Loop errors compound quickly
2. **Check Early** - Catch infinite loops before frustration
3. **Trace Together** - Model debugging thinking
4. **Celebrate Success** - First working loop is big milestone!

# Common Teaching Challenges

## Challenge 1: Infinite Loops Create Fear

**Solution**:
- Demo how to stop them first
- Show it's normal/fixable
- Make it less scary

## Challenge 2: Syntax Overwhelms Concepts

**Solution**:
- Patterns first, syntax second
- Provide templates
- Focus on problem-solving

## Challenge 3: Index Arithmetic

**Solution**:
- Always draw pictures
- Use physical props (numbered cards)
- Practice extensively

## Challenge 4: Debugging Loop Logic

**Solution**:
- Teach print() debugging
- Trace tables on board
- Think aloud while debugging

# Assessment Strategies

## Quick Formative Checks

During lecture, ask:
- "How many times will this loop run?"
- "What's the third element's index?"
- "Will this loop ever end?"

## Lab Observation Points

Watch for:
- Choosing wrong loop type
- Forgetting to update loop variable
- Index boundary errors
- Empty list handling

## Project Evaluation Focus

Priority order:
1. Basic functionality works
2. Handles edge cases
3. User-friendly interface
4. Code organisation
5. Enhancements

# Differentiation Strategies

## For Struggling Students

1. **More Visualisation**
   - Trace every loop
   - Draw every list
   - Step through slowly

2. **Simpler Examples**
   - Count to 3, not 10
   - Lists of 2-3 items
   - One concept at a time

3. **Pair Programming**
   - Match with patient partner
   - Switch roles regularly
   - Encourage questions

## For Advanced Students

1. **Pattern Challenges**
   - Nested patterns (preview)
   - Efficiency questions
   - Multiple solutions

2. **Enhanced Features**
   - Sort the shopping list
   - Prevent duplicates
   - Category organisation

3. **Algorithm Thinking**
   - Different search methods
   - Optimisation ideas
   - Edge case handling

# Week 3 Specific Reminders

1. **Loops Enable Everything** - This is where programming becomes powerful
2. **Patience is Critical** - Conceptual leap is large
3. **Errors are Learning** - Normalise debugging
4. **Patterns Over Syntax** - Recognition before writing
5. **Success Builds Success** - Celebrate working loops!

## Most Important
Students who struggle with loops often struggle rest of course. Invest time here to ensure solid foundation. Better to go slowly and build confidence than rush and create confusion.
