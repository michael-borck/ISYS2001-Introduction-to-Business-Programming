1. **Build a progression of complexity**: Your current materials already show a nice progression from basic to more complex interactions. Consider organizing exercises that explicitly build from simpler concepts to more complex integrations.

2. **Incorporate reflection points**: Add more structured reflection prompts throughout your materials to help students internalize what they're learning about both programming concepts and effective prompting.

3. **Add visual guides**: Consider creating flowcharts of effective prompting patterns that students can reference. This could show the decision tree of when to use different types of prompts.

4. **Create starter templates**: Provide students with "prompt templates" for different programming scenarios that they can customize.

5. **Peer review component**: Add an exercise where students review each other's AI conversations and identify ways to improve their prompting.

6. **Challenge scenarios**: Include specific programming challenges where the AI is intentionally programmed to provide initially flawed solutions, requiring careful prompting to resolve.

## Key Improvements in the New Materials

1. The **Complete AI Programming Conversation Exercise** provides a fully worked example that follows your six-step methodology while showing non-linear paths students might explore.

2. The **Guide to Intentional Prompting** explains the concept, categorizes different types of prompts, and provides concrete patterns students can follow.

3. The **Prompt Templates** document organizes effective prompts by the six core programming concepts from your handout, giving students a reference library.

4. The **Assessment Guide** helps you evaluate student progress in AI prompting as a skill, with rubrics and sample activities.

5. The **Loops Worksheet** demonstrates how one specific core concept can be deeply explored through the intentional prompting approach.

These materials complement your existing worksheets by providing more structured guidance, conceptual frameworks, and practical exercises that turn AI interactions into meaningful learning experiences.
