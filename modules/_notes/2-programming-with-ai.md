### PART 1 — Understanding the Problem (with AI support)

| Step | What You Do | Your Prompt to the AI | AI Response Notes |
|------|-------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| 1. Restate the problem | Rephrase it in your own words | `"Can you help me restate this problem clearly: I need a program that calculates average test scores?"` | |
| 2. Identify Input & Output | Figure out what goes in/out | `"What inputs does this program need? What should it output?"` | |
| 3. Work it by hand | Try an example yourself | N/A – write down how you’d manually do it | |
| 4. Write pseudo code | Ask AI to help with steps | `"Can you help me write pseudocode for this problem?"` | |

### PART 2 — Coding with AI

| Step | Your Goal | Your Prompt to the AI | AI Code / Response |
|------|-----------|------------------------|--------------------|
| 5. Convert to Python | Ask AI to write code from the pseudocode | `"Can you convert the pseudocode above into working Python code?"` | |
| 6. Test with data | Try different examples | `"Can you show how this program would work with scores: 90, 85, 78?"` | |
| 🛠 Debug or Refine | Identify & fix issues | `"The code gives an error if I enter nothing. Can you help me fix that?"` | |

## 🛠 Bonus: Explore Programming Concepts with the AI

Ask AI to explain or show examples for:

| Concept     | Prompt Example |
|-------------|----------------|
| Input       | `"How do I get user input in Python?"` |
| Output      | `"What’s the difference between print() and return?"` |
| Store       | `"How do I store numbers in a list?"` |
| Calculate   | `"What’s the difference between / and // in Python?"` |
| Decisions   | `"How do I use if-else to check for a passing score?"` |
| Repeat      | `"How do I loop through a list of scores?"` |
