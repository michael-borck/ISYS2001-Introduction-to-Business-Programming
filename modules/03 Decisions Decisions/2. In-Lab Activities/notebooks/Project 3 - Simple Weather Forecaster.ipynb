        "# Project: Simple Weather Forecaster\n",
        "\n",
        "## Project Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "In this project you will create a basic weather forecasting script that:\n",
        "- **Displays a Menu:**  \n",
        "  Presents options such as:  \n",
        "  1. Check Temperature  \n",
        "  2. Check Humidity  \n",
        "  3. Check Wind Speed  \n",
        "  4. Exit\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Handles User Input:**  \n",
        "  Based on the selected option, the script will ask for a related input. For example, if “Check Temperature” is selected, the program prompts the user to input the current temperature.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Implements Decision Logic:**  \n",
        "  Uses if-else statements to analyse the input. For instance:  \n",
        "  - If the temperature is below a certain threshold, print “It’s cold – expect a chilly day.”\n",
        "  - If the temperature is moderate, print “It’s a pleasant day.”\n",
        "  - Similar simple logic can be applied for humidity and wind speed.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Integration and Reflection:**  \n",
        "  The focus is on understanding how conditionals make decisions.  \n",
        "  Next week, the code will be refactored to use functions, but for now, all logic is written directly in the main block.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Advanced Concept:** Previously, we wrote simple programs that executed one line after another (this is called a \"sequence\"). This week, we use if-else statements to make decisions, which is known as \"selection\"—another fundamental building block in programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Tip:** Focus on understanding the underlying concepts rather than merely obtaining a working program. While AI tools can help you quickly produce a final solution, the purpose of this worksheet is for you to engage with and understand the material. Use the provided starter code and AI prompts as guides to learn and reflect on the decision-making process, rather than just copying the final product. "

        "\n",
        "1. **Display a Menu:**  \n",
        "   Create a text-based menu that presents the following options:\n",
        "   - Check Temperature\n",
        "   - Check Humidity\n",
        "   - Check Wind Speed\n",

        "   Based on the option selected, prompt the user for a related input. For example, if the user selects \"Check Temperature\", ask:\n",
        "   \n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Implement Decision Logic:**  \n",
        "   Use if-else statements to provide a weather forecast based on the input. For example:\n",
        "   \n",
        "   ```python\n",
