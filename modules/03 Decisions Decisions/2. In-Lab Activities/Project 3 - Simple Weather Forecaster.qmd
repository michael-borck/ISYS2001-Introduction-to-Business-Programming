# Project: Simple Weather Forecaster

## Project Overview

In this project you will create a basic weather forecasting script that:
- **Displays a Menu:**  
  Presents options such as:  
  1. Check Temperature  
  2. Check Humidity  
  3. Check Wind Speed  
  4. Exit

- **Handles User Input:**  
  Based on the selected option, the script will ask for a related input. For example, if “Check Temperature” is selected, the program prompts the user to input the current temperature.

- **Implements Decision Logic:**  
  Uses if-else statements to analyse the input. For instance:  
  - If the temperature is below a certain threshold, print “It’s cold – expect a chilly day.”
  - If the temperature is moderate, print “It’s a pleasant day.”
  - Similar simple logic can be applied for humidity and wind speed.

- **Integration and Reflection:**  
  The focus is on understanding how conditionals make decisions.  
  Next week, the code will be refactored to use functions, but for now, all logic is written directly in the main block.

> **Advanced Concept:** Previously, we wrote simple programs that executed one line after another (this is called a "sequence"). This week, we use if-else statements to make decisions, which is known as "selection"—another fundamental building block in programming.

> **Tip:** Focus on understanding the underlying concepts rather than merely obtaining a working program. While AI tools can help you quickly produce a final solution, the purpose of this worksheet is for you to engage with and understand the material. Use the provided starter code and AI prompts as guides to learn and reflect on the decision-making process, rather than just copying the final product.

## Project Requirements

- **Tools:**  
  Use only `print()`, `input()`, variables, and basic data types.
  
- **Creativity:**  
  Be creative in designing simple weather messages.
  
- **Submission:**  
  Save your project in a Google Colab Notebook and push the final version to GitHub.

> **Tip:** Focus on writing clear and readable code. Descriptive variable names and proper formatting help you and others understand your program later.

## Project Tips

> **Tip:** Clarity over complexity is key—ensure your decision logic is easy to follow.

> **AI Usage:** If you need hints on improving readability or understanding your code, consider using AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) to get explanations. Always verify that you understand the code you write.

> **Tip:** Plan ahead by drawing a decision tree to organise your logic and cover all decision paths.

## Project Instructions

1. **Display a Menu:**  
   Create a text-based menu that presents the following options:
   - Check Temperature
   - Check Humidity
   - Check Wind Speed
   - Exit

   Use the `print()` function to display the menu and `input()` to capture the user's selection.

2. **Handle User Input:**  
   Based on the option selected, prompt the user for a related input. For example, if the user selects "Check Temperature", ask:
   
   ```python
   temp_input = input("Enter the current temperature (in °C): ")
   ```
   
   > **Note:** Remember that input() always returns a string. Even if you type a number, it is read as a string. You must convert it to a number using int() (or float()) if you want to perform numerical comparisons.

3. **Implement Decision Logic:**  
   Use if-else statements to provide a weather forecast based on the input. For example:
   
   ```python
   if temp_input.isdigit() or (temp_input.startswith('-') and temp_input[1:].isdigit()):
       temperature = int(temp_input)
       if temperature < 15:
           print("It’s cold – expect a chilly day.")
       elif temperature < 25:
           print("It’s a pleasant day.")
       else:
           print("It’s hot – stay cool!")
   else:
       print("Invalid input. Please enter a numeric temperature.")
   ```
   
   > **Tip:** The if-else statement checks if the input is numeric, accounting for negative numbers by checking if the string starts with a '-' and the rest are digits.

4. **Integrate and Reflect:**  
   - Ensure that all the code is written in one main block (without using functions or loops at this stage).
   - Test your program by simulating different user inputs.
   - Reflect on how the decision-making process works and how the program chooses the appropriate message.

> **AI Prompt:** If you get stuck, ask, "Can you explain how if-else statements help a program make decisions?" to get more clarity on this concept.

## Example Project Structure

Below is an example outline to help you structure your code:

```python
# Display the Weather Menu
print("Weather Menu:")
print("1. Check Temperature")
print("2. Check Humidity")
print("3. Check Wind Speed")
print("4. Exit")

# Capture the user's menu selection
choice = input("Enter your choice (1-4): ")

# Process the user's selection
if choice == "1":
    # Check Temperature
    temp_input = input("Enter the current temperature (in °C): ")
    if temp_input.isdigit() or (temp_input.startswith('-') and temp_input[1:].isdigit()):
        temperature = int(temp_input)
        if temperature < 15:
            print("It’s cold – expect a chilly day.")
        elif temperature < 25:
            print("It’s a pleasant day.")
        else:
            print("It’s hot – stay cool!")
    else:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a numeric temperature.")
elif choice == "2":
    # Check Humidity
    humidity_input = input("Enter the current humidity (in %): ")
    # You can add similar logic for humidity here.
    print("Humidity functionality coming soon!")
elif choice == "3":
    # Check Wind Speed
    wind_input = input("Enter the current wind speed (in km/h): ")
    # You can add similar logic for wind speed here.
    print("Wind speed functionality coming soon!")
elif choice == "4":
    print("Exiting the program. Have a great day!")
else:
    print("Invalid choice. Please select a valid option.")
```

> **Tip:** Indentation is crucial in Python. After the colon (`:`), the indented block of code is what gets executed when the condition is true. This is how Python defines which block of code belongs to which condition.

## Reflection

After completing your project, reflect on the following:
- How did you design your decision tree for each menu option?
- What challenges did you face when handling user input and ensuring valid data?
- How might you improve the user experience in your weather forecaster?
- How can using AI tools help you understand parts of the code you find challenging?

> **Tip:** Write down your reflections and be prepared to discuss them in class.

> **AI Prompt:** If you're not sure where to start with your reflections, ask, "What are some common challenges when designing decision logic in Python?" for ideas.

## Final Notes

Remember, the focus of this project is on understanding how conditionals work to make decisions in your code.  
Take your time to test your program thoroughly and refine your logic based on the outcomes.  
Enjoy building your weather forecaster, and happy coding!

> **Note:** As you continue your learning journey, you'll refine your code using functions and loops. For now, concentrate on mastering if-else statements and user input.
