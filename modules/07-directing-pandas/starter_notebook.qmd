# 🚀 Getting Started: Foundation Setup

## Initial Setup
This cell installs the necessary libraries. In a Colab environment, you would uncomment the first line.

```{python}
# Uncomment the line below when running in Google Colab
# !pip install gradio pandas hands-on-ai

# Import core libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from datetime import datetime
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

print("📦 Core libraries loaded successfully!")
print(f"Pandas version: {pd.__version__}")
```

## Hands-on-AI Configuration

Set up the hands-on-ai package for advanced features (chat, RAG, tools):

```{python}
import os
from getpass import getpass

# Configure hands-on-ai server connection
os.environ['HANDS_ON_AI_SERVER'] = 'http://ollama.serveur.au'
os.environ['HANDS_ON_AI_MODEL'] = 'granite3.2'
os.environ['HANDS_ON_AI_API_KEY'] = getpass('Enter your API key: ')

print("🔑 Hands-on-AI configured successfully!")
```

## Connection Test

Test that everything is working correctly:

```{python}
from hands_on_ai import chat

# Test the connection to the hands-on-ai server
try:
    response = chat.say("Hello! I'm building a Smart Finance Assistant.")
    print("✅ Hands-on-AI connection successful!")
    print(f"Response: {response}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"❌ Connection issue: {e}")
    print("You can still work on the data processing foundation without this.")
```

## Sample Transaction Data Setup

Create or load sample transaction data to work with:

```{python}
# 🤖 AI Collaboration Opportunity:
# Ask AI to help you create realistic sample transaction data
# Include Australian businesses and various spending categories

# Sample data structure for testing
sample_transactions = {
    'Date': ['2024-08-01', '2024-08-02', '2024-08-03', '2024-08-04', '2024-08-05'],
    'Amount': ['$45.50', '$12.00', '$89.95', '$3.50', '-$25.00'],  # Note: includes $ signs and refund
    'Category': ['Groceries', 'Transport', 'Entertainment', 'Coffee', 'Refund'],
    'Description': ['Woolworths', 'Opal Card', 'Concert Tickets', 'Campus Cafe', 'Returned Item']
}

# Create DataFrame from sample data
df_sample = pd.DataFrame(sample_transactions)
print("📋 Sample transaction data created:")
print(df_sample)
```

# 📊 Six-Step Development Methodology

Your notebook must demonstrate the six-step methodology with clear evidence of AI collaboration at each step.

## STEP 1: Understand the Problem

**🎯 Define Your Finance Problem**

In this section, clearly state your chosen finance problem in business terms.

::: {.callout-note}
## Problem Definition Template

*Example: "I want to help people understand their spending habits by analyzing their bank transaction exports. The system should identify spending patterns, highlight potential savings opportunities, and provide actionable financial insights in easy-to-understand language."*

**🤖 AI Prompt to Try:**
```
"Help me brainstorm specific personal finance problems that could be solved 
with a CSV analysis tool. I'm interested in helping people with budgeting 
and spending awareness. What are common financial challenges that data 
analysis could address?"
```
:::

**Your Problem Statement:**
[Write your specific finance problem here - be clear about who you're helping and what value you're providing]

## STEP 2: Identify Inputs and Outputs

**📥 Define Your Data Flow**

Clearly specify what data you'll work with and what insights you'll generate.

::: {.callout-note}
## Input/Output Analysis Template

**Inputs:**
- CSV file with transaction data (columns: Date, Amount, Category, Description)
- User preferences (spending goals, categories to focus on)
- Time period for analysis

**Outputs:**
- Total spending summary by category
- Average spending patterns
- Spending trend analysis
- Actionable savings recommendations
- Visual spending breakdown (future enhancement)

**🤖 AI Prompt to Try:**
```
"For a personal finance assistant that analyzes CSV transaction data, 
what are the most valuable inputs I should collect and outputs I should 
provide? Consider both technical data processing and business value 
for the user."
```
:::

**Your Input/Output Definition:**
[Define your specific inputs and outputs here]

## STEP 3: Work the Problem by Hand

**✋ Manual Calculation Examples**

Show 2-3 worked examples to understand the logic before coding.

::: {.callout-note}
## Example Business Calculation

Given this sample data:

| Date | Amount | Category | Description |
|------|--------|----------|-------------|
| 2024-08-01 | $45.50 | Groceries | Woolworths |
| 2024-08-02 | $12.00 | Transport | Opal Card |
| 2024-08-03 | $89.95 | Entertainment | Concert |
| 2024-08-04 | -$15.00 | Refund | Returned item |

**Manual Calculations:**
- Total Spending: $45.50 + $12.00 + $89.95 - $15.00 = $132.45
- By Category: Groceries $45.50, Transport $12.00, Entertainment $89.95
- Average Transaction: $132.45 ÷ 4 = $33.11
- Insight: Entertainment represents 67% of positive spending

**🤖 AI Prompt to Try:**
```
"Give me 3 realistic examples of Australian transaction data with different 
scenarios (normal spending, refunds, large purchases). Show me how to manually 
calculate meaningful financial insights from each scenario."
```
:::

**Your Manual Examples:**
[Work through your own examples here - this helps you understand the business logic]

## STEP 4: Write Pseudocode

**📝 Plan Your Solution Logic**

Sketch the algorithm in plain English before coding.

::: {.callout-note}
## Pseudocode Template

```
FUNCTION analyze_spending_data(csv_file):
    // Step 1: Load and validate data
    - Read CSV file into DataFrame
    - Check for required columns (Date, Amount, Category, Description)
    - Handle missing or invalid data
    
    // Step 2: Clean financial data  
    - Remove dollar signs from Amount column
    - Convert to numeric values
    - Separate positive spending from refunds
    
    // Step 3: Calculate business metrics
    - Group transactions by category
    - Calculate totals, averages, counts per category
    - Identify spending patterns and outliers
    
    // Step 4: Generate insights
    - Calculate percentages of total spending
    - Identify top spending categories
    - Suggest potential savings opportunities
    
    // Step 5: Format for presentation
    - Create business-friendly output
    - Include currency formatting
    - Add explanatory text for insights
    
    RETURN formatted_analysis
```

**🤖 AI Prompt to Try:**
