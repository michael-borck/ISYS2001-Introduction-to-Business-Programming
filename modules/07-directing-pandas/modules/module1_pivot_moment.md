# The Old Way vs The New Way

## The Old Way: Code Writer 🖊️

- You write every single line of code yourself
- You memorise syntax and function names
- You spend hours debugging typos and syntax errors
- You feel stuck when you can't remember how something works
- Programming feels slow and frustrating

## The New Way: Code Director 🎬

- You describe what you want the code to do
- AI writes the initial code for you
- You review, understand, and improve the AI's work
- You focus on the business logic, not the syntax
- Programming becomes faster and more creative

::: {.notes}
This slide contrasts the traditional coding approach with a more modern, AI-assisted method. In the past, programmers had to write every line of code themselves, memorise syntax and function names, and spend hours debugging errors. This could lead to feelings of frustration and being stuck when unable to recall how something worked, making programming a slow process.

Now, with AI assistance, programmers can describe what they want the code to do and have the AI generate the initial code for them. The programmer's role shifts to reviewing, understanding, and improving the AI-generated code, allowing them to focus more on the business logic rather than getting bogged down in syntax details. This evolution of the programming process enables faster and more creative development.

# This Isn't Cheating - It's Evolution

In the business world, managers don't write every email themselves - they have assistants. Architects don't lay every brick - they direct construction teams. Similarly, modern programmers don't write every line of code - they collaborate with AI tools.

**Your role is shifting from coder to code director.**

::: {.notes}
This evolution from code writer to code director is a natural progression in the era of AI-enhanced programming. Rather than spending hours meticulously writing every line of code yourself, you can now collaborate with AI to craft elegant and efficient solutions more quickly.

Embracing this new paradigm doesn't mean abandoning your programming skills; on the contrary, it allows you to focus on higher-level problem solving, architecture design, and creative thinking. By leveraging AI as a powerful tool in your toolkit, you can achieve better results with less tedium and frustration, freeing you to tackle more challenging and rewarding projects.

# What This Means for Your Assignment

Speaking of assignments... **you're about to start your final project today!** The "Smart Finance Assistant" that you'll build over the coming weeks begins right here in Week 8. No more assignment anxiety - by the end of today's workshop, you'll have made real progress on your final project.

::: {.notes}
Your assignment will shift from writing code yourself to directing AI to write code for you. This means you'll need to think more about the problem you're solving and the steps involved, rather than the specific code syntax. 

Focus on breaking down the problem, planning the solution, and providing clear instructions to the AI. You'll still need to review and test the generated code, but the AI can handle many of the low-level coding tasks. This will allow you to concentrate on the bigger picture and solve problems more efficiently.

# The 6-Step Problem Solving Method (AI-Enhanced Edition)

You already know our problem-solving framework. Here's how it adapts to AI collaboration:

1. **Understand the Problem** → _Ask AI to help clarify requirements_
2. **Plan the Solution** → _Brainstorm approaches with AI_
3. **Choose Tools** → _Let AI recommend the best libraries/methods_
4. **Implement** → _AI writes code, you review and guide_
5. **Test & Debug** → _AI helps identify and fix issues_
6. **Document** → _AI helps create clear documentation_

::: {.notes}
1. The 6-Step Problem Solving Method (AI-Enhanced Edition) modernises the traditional problem-solving approach by integrating artificial intelligence. This updated method enables you to tackle complex programming tasks more efficiently and effectively, leveraging the power of AI to streamline the process. By following these six steps, you can break down problems into manageable components, utilise AI assistance strategically, and develop robust solutions.

2. The six steps of the AI-enhanced problem-solving method are as follows: 1) Understand the problem, 2) Break it down into smaller subproblems, 3) Consider AI assistance for each subproblem, 4) Develop a solution plan, 5) Implement the solution using AI tools when appropriate, and 6) Test and refine the solution. By incorporating AI throughout the problem-solving process, you can optimise your workflow, reduce coding time, and produce higher-quality results. Embrace this evolved approach to problem-solving and take your programming skills to the next level.

# Real Business Context

Imagine you're working as a Business Analyst at Commonwealth Bank. Your manager asks you to:

_"Can you analyze our customer transaction data and create a summary report showing spending patterns by category? I need it by Friday for the board meeting."_

**Old approach:** Panic. Spend days learning pandas syntax. Write buggy code. Miss deadline.

**New approach:** Describe the task to AI. Get working code in minutes. Focus on understanding the business insights. Deliver early and impress your manager.

::: {.notes}
Real business context is crucial when applying programming skills to solve problems. By understanding the specific industry, company, and project goals, you can develop solutions that are highly relevant and impactful. This involves researching the domain, engaging with stakeholders, and asking questions to gain a deep understanding of the business needs and challenges.

When you have a solid grasp of the real business context, you can approach problem-solving with a strategic mindset. Instead of simply writing code, you'll be able to make informed decisions about architecture, technologies, and trade-offs that align with the business objectives. This context-driven approach leads to solutions that not only work but also deliver tangible value to the organisation.
