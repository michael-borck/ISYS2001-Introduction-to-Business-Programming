## Setup and Workflow

1. Open your web browser and log in to GitHub.
2. Open Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/).
3. Either open [Weather_Function_Exercise](https://github.com/teaching-repositories/ISYS2001/blob/main/Weather_Functions_Exercise.ipynb) or create a new notebook and rename it to "Weather_Functions_Exercise".
4. Save the notebook to your GitHub repository.
5. As you complete each exercise, commit your changes to GitHub to track your progress.

## Using Generative AI as a Learning Tool

Generative AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude can be valuable resources in your
learning process. However, it's crucial to use them strategically to enhance
your understanding rather than simply obtaining answers. Here are some
guidelines:

1. Use AI to explain concepts: If you're struggling with a Python concept or
   function, ask the AI to explain it in simple terms or provide analogies.
2. Request step-by-step problem-solving: Instead of asking for complete code,
   ask the AI to outline the steps needed to solve a problem. This helps you
   understand the logic without getting the full solution.
3. Verify and understand AI-generated code: If you do get code from an AI, make
   sure you understand every line. Ask the AI to explain any parts you don't
   understand.
4. Use AI for debugging: If your code isn't working, ask the AI to help you
   identify potential issues or explain error messages.
5. Explore alternatives: Ask the AI about different ways to solve a problem.
   This can help you learn multiple approaches and understand their trade-offs.
6. Practice critical thinking: Don't assume the AI is always correct. Verify its
   suggestions and cross-reference with official documentation or other sources.

## Exercises

### 1. GenAI Exercise

Question 1: Think of a weather-related programming task you're unsure how to
approach. Write a strategic question you could ask an AI assistant to help you
learn without directly solving the problem for you.

### 2. Introduction to Functions

Question 2: Explain in your own words what a function is in Python and why we
use them.

Question 3: Write the general syntax for defining a function in Python. Use
comments to explain each part.


### 3. Using Built-in Functions

For the following exercises, use these lists:

```{python}
temperatures = [22, 24, 19, 21, 25, 23, 20]  # Weekly temperature data (°C)
humidity = [60, 55, 65, 58, 50, 57, 62]      # Weekly humidity data (%)
```

Question 4: How would you calculate the number of days in the dataset using a
built-in function?

```{python}
# Put your answer here

```

Question 5: Write a line of code to calculate the total temperature for the
week.

```{python}
# Put your answer here

```

Question 6: Calculate the average humidity. (Hint: You'll need to use two
built-in functions)

```{python}
# Put your answer here

```

### 4. Creating Weather-related Functions

Question 7: Write a function called `celsius_to_fahrenheit` that converts a
temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit. (Hint: The formula is F = (C * 9/5) +
32)

```{python}
# Put your answer here

```


Question 8: Create a function named `average_temperature` that takes a list of
temperatures and returns the average.

```{python}
# Put your answer here

```


Question 9: Define a function called `weather_description` that takes
temperature and humidity as parameters and returns a description based on the
following criteria:

- If temperature > 25°C and humidity < 60%: "Hot and Dry"
- If temperature > 25°C and humidity >= 60%: "Hot and Humid"
- If 15°C <= temperature <= 25°C and humidity < 60%: "Pleasant"
- If 15°C <= temperature <= 25°C and humidity >= 60%: "Comfortable but Humid"
- Otherwise: "Cool"

```{python}
# Put your answer here

```


### 5. Using Third-party Libraries: NumPy

For the following questions, assume you have already imported numpy as np.

Question 10: Using NumPy, create an array called `temp_array` from the
`temperatures` list.

```{python}
# Put your answer here

```


Question 11: Using Numpy, Calculate the following statistics for `temp_array`:

a) Mean temperature
b) Maximum temperature
c) Minimum temperature
d) Standard deviation of temperatures

```{python}
# Put your answer here

```


### 6 Putting It All Together

Question 12: Create a simple weather dashboard that uses the functions you've created earlier. Your dashboard should:

a) Use the `temperatures` and `humidity` lists from earlier exercises.
b) Utilise the `celsius_to_fahrenheit`, `average_temperature`, and `weather_description` functions you created.
c) Use NumPy to perform some calculations.
d) Display the following information:
   - Daily weather description for each day
   - Average temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit
   - The hottest and coldest days of the week
   - A summary of how many days were in each weather category (e.g., "Hot and Dry", "Pleasant", etc.)

Write a Python script that creates this dashboard. You can display the
information using print statements.

Hint: You might want to use a loop to go through the daily data, and you can use
a dictionary to keep track of the count of different weather descriptions.

```{python}
# Put your answer here

```


### 7 Reflection

Question 13: Briefly explain how functions have helped in organising and
simplifying the code in this weather data analysis exercise.

### 6 Additional Exercises (Optional)

- Create a new NumPy array that contains the temperature differences
between consecutive days. (Hint: Look up NumPy's `diff()` function)


```{python}
# Put your answer here

```


- Use NumPy to find all days where the temperature was above 23°C.
Return both the temperatures and their indices.


```{python}
# Put your answer here

```


- Write a function that converts wind speed from m/s to km/h. (Hint:
1 m/s = 3.6 km/h)


```{python}
# Put your answer here

```


- Create a function that calculates the heat index given temperature
(in Celsius) and relative humidity. You can use a simplified formula:

    HI = c1 + c2T + c3R + c4T*R + c5T^2 + c6R^2 + c7T^2*R + c8T*R^2 + c9T^2*R^2

    Where T is temperature, R is relative humidity (as a whole number, not a
    percentage), and c1 to c9 are constants you can look up.


```{python}
# Put your answer here

```


- How would you use pandas to read weather data from a CSV file named
'weather_data.csv' and display the first 5 rows?

```{python}
# Put your answer here

```


- Describe how you would create a scatter plot using matplotlib to
show the relationship between temperature and humidity.


```{python}
# Put your answer here

```
