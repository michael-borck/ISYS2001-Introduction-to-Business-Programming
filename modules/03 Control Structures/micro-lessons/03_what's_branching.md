**Aim**
The aim of this lesson is to introduce the concept of branching in programming and explain how it allows programs to make decisions based on certain conditions.

**Context**
This lesson follows on from the "Recall - Six Things" lesson and precedes lessons on Boolean expressions, operators, and specific examples of branching in Python. It provides a foundation for understanding how programs can respond differently based on input or calculated values.

**Making decisions in code**
Branching is a fundamental concept in programming that allows code to make decisions. Just as we make decisions in our daily lives based on certain conditions, programs can also evaluate conditions and execute different blocks of code depending on whether those conditions are met. This enables programs to respond intelligently and perform different actions in different situations.

**Uses conditional statements (if-else)**
The most common way to implement branching in code is through the use of conditional statements, particularly the if-else statement. An if statement checks whether a condition is true, and if so, executes a certain block of code. If the condition is false, an else block can be used to specify an alternative action. This allows the program to choose between two different paths based on the outcome of the condition.

**Like checking weather forecasts**
Branching can be thought of as similar to checking a weather forecast before deciding what to wear or whether to bring an umbrella. The program checks certain conditions, such as the current temperature or chance of rain, and then chooses an appropriate course of action based on those conditions. This analogy helps to illustrate the decision-making process that branching enables in programs.

**Determines program flow**
Branching is a key factor in determining the flow of a program. When a program reaches a branching point, such as an if statement, it will follow a different path depending on the outcome of the condition. This means that the program's execution can vary based on the input it receives or the values it calculates, leading to different outcomes or outputs.

**Enables responsive program behaviour**
By using branching, programs can be designed to respond intelligently to different situations. For example, a program could use branching to provide personalised recommendations based on user input, or to handle errors gracefully by executing different code when something goes wrong. This flexibility and responsiveness is a crucial aspect of creating programs that are useful and engaging for users.
