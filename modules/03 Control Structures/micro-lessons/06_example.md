**Aim**
This lesson aims to introduce logical operators and their role in creating more complex conditions in branching and repetition structures.

**Context**
Following the discussion of boolean expressions and common boolean operators, this lesson delves into logical operators. It sets the stage for the subsequent lessons that demonstrate how these operators are used in Python's if-then-else and loop constructs.

**Logical Operators** 
Logical operators allow programmers to combine multiple boolean expressions to create more sophisticated conditions. The three main logical operators are AND, OR, and NOT. The AND operator returns True only if both operands are True. The OR operator returns True if at least one of the operands is True. The NOT operator negates the value of a single operand, returning the opposite boolean value.
