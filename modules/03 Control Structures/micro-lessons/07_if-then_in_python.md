**Aim**
To introduce the if-then statement in Python and explain its purpose and syntax.

**Context**
Following an introduction to branching and boolean expressions, this lesson focuses on the if-then statement in Python. The next lessons will cover else and elif statements, allowing for more complex decision-making in Python programs.

**Checks a condition** The if-then statement in Python is used to check a specific condition. It evaluates a boolean expression, which can be either True or False. This allows the program to make decisions based on the state of variables or the result of comparisons.

**Executes if condition is True** If the condition in the if statement evaluates to True, the code block following the if statement is executed. This code block can contain one or more statements that are run only when the condition is met. If the condition is False, the code block is skipped.

**Can include multiple statements** The code block following an if statement can include multiple lines of code. All of these statements will be executed if the condition is True. It's important to note that all statements in the block must be indented to the same level.

**Indentation is important** In Python, indentation is used to define code blocks. After an if statement, the code block must be indented (usually by 4 spaces). This indentation tells Python which lines of code belong to the if statement. Incorrect indentation can lead to syntax errors.

**Use for simple decisions** If-then statements are best used for simple decision-making in a program. When there are only two possible outcomes based on a condition (i.e., the condition is either True or False), an if-then statement is a clear and concise way to control the flow of the program.
