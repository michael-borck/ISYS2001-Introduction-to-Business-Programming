**Aim**
Teach students how to create reusable weather logic by extracting common code into functions, making their programs more modular and maintainable.

**Context**
This lesson follows the "Quick Forecasts" lesson, which introduced the concept of using functions to simplify code. It precedes the "Applying Functions with Loops" lesson, which will demonstrate how to combine functions with loops for more efficient weather data processing.
