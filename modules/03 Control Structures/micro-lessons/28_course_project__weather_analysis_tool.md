**Aim**
The purpose of this lesson is to provide an overview of the course project, which is a weather analysis tool that brings together all the concepts learned throughout the course.

**Context**
This lesson comes near the end of the presentation, after covering various programming concepts such as branching, loops, functions, and data structures. It ties these concepts together into a practical, real-world application.

**Combine all learned concepts** The weather analysis tool project will integrate all the key programming concepts covered in the course, including branching with if-else statements and Boolean expressions, repetition using for and while loops, reusable code through functions, and data storage and manipulation using dictionaries. By combining these concepts, students will demonstrate their understanding and ability to apply them in a cohesive manner.

**Process historical weather data** One of the main tasks of the weather analysis tool will be to process and analyse historical weather data. Students will learn how to read weather data from files or databases, clean and preprocess the data as needed, and perform statistical analyses to extract meaningful insights about past weather patterns.

**Generate weather reports** Using the processed historical data, the weather analysis tool will generate informative weather reports. These reports may include summary statistics, visualisations such as graphs and charts, and textual descriptions of notable weather events or trends. Students will learn how to present weather data in a clear and concise manner.

**Predict future weather patterns** Building upon the analysis of historical data, students will explore basic machine learning techniques to predict future weather patterns. This may involve training simple models on past data to forecast temperature, precipitation, or other weather variables. Through this component, students will gain an introduction to the fundamental concepts of machine learning and its applications in weather prediction.

**Create a user-friendly interface** To make the weather analysis tool accessible and easy to use, students will design and implement a user-friendly interface. This may involve creating a command-line interface that accepts user input, displays menu options, and presents weather information in a clear and organised fashion. Students will learn how to design intuitive user interactions and handle user input effectively.
