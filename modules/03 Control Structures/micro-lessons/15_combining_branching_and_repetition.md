**Aim**
This lesson aims to show how branching and repetition can be combined in Python programs to create more powerful and flexible logic.

**Context**
Having covered branching with if-elif-else statements and repetition with for and while loops separately, this lesson demonstrates how these concepts can be used together. It leads into a practical example in the next lesson, "Weather Station Simulator".
