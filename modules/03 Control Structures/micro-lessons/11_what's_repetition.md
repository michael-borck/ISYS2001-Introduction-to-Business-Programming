**Aim**
The aim of this lesson is to introduce the concept of repetition in programming and explain its role in automating tasks.

**Context**
Having covered branching and conditionals in previous lessons, this lesson introduces repetition as another fundamental programming concept. It sets the stage for the following lessons which will delve into specific loop constructs in Python, such as for loops and while loops.

**Executing code multiple times**
Repetition in programming refers to the ability to execute a block of code multiple times. This is a powerful feature that allows programmers to automate repetitive tasks and process large amounts of data efficiently. Instead of manually writing the same code over and over, repetition constructs enable the code to be executed as many times as needed.

**Uses loops (for, while)**
In Python, repetition is achieved through the use of loops. The two main types of loops are for loops and while loops. For loops are used when the number of iterations is known in advance, such as iterating over a sequence of elements. While loops, on the other hand, are used when the number of iterations is not known and depends on a certain condition being met.

**Like daily weather checks**
A real-world analogy for repetition is performing daily weather checks. Just as we might check the weather forecast every morning to plan our day, a program can use repetition to perform a task or check a condition repeatedly. This could involve retrieving data from a weather API, processing it, and updating a display or sending notifications based on the current weather conditions.

**Automates repetitive tasks**
One of the key benefits of repetition in programming is its ability to automate repetitive tasks. Instead of manually performing the same action over and over, loops allow us to write code once and have it execute multiple times. This saves time, reduces the risk of errors, and makes our code more concise and maintainable.

**Efficient for data processing**
Repetition is particularly useful when it comes to processing large amounts of data. Whether it's iterating over a list of items, reading data from a file, or querying a database, loops enable us to efficiently process and manipulate data. By using repetition constructs, we can perform operations on each element of a dataset without having to write separate code for each individual item.
