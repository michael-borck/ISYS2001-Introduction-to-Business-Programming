**Learning Objectives**

- Identify common code patterns in weather data processing
- Extract reusable logic into well-defined functions
- Improve code modularity and maintainability through function usage

**Introduction**



**Aim**
Teach students how to create reusable weather logic by extracting common code into functions, making their programs more modular and maintainable.

**Context**
This lesson follows the "Quick Forecasts" lesson, which introduced the concept of using functions to simplify code. It precedes the "Applying Functions with Loops" lesson, which will demonstrate how to combine functions with loops for more efficient weather data processing.

**Key Takeaways**

- Functions allow you to encapsulate reusable logic and avoid code duplication
- By extracting common weather data processing tasks into functions, your code becomes more modular and easier to maintain
- Well-defined functions with clear inputs and outputs make your code more readable and understandable
- Reusable functions can be shared across multiple weather-related projects, saving time and effort

**Quick Quiz**

1. What is the main benefit of extracting reusable weather logic into functions?
   Answer: It makes the code more modular and maintainable by avoiding code duplication.

2. How can well-defined functions make your code more readable?
   Answer: By providing clear inputs and outputs, making the purpose of the function easier to understand.
