**Learning Objectives**

- Understand how to leverage GenAI as a personalized Python tutor to enhance learning and problem-solving skills.
- Apply GenAI's capabilities to get explanations, examples, practice questions, debugging assistance, and explore real-world weather applications using Python.

**Introduction**

Following the presentation's sections on Python branching, repetition, and functions in weather applications, this lesson introduces GenAI as a learning tool to support Python skill development. It precedes lessons on effective GenAI learning strategies and the course project of building a weather analysis tool.

**Ask for concept explanations**
When learning Python, you can ask GenAI to explain programming concepts in detail. For example, you could ask it to clarify the difference between for and while loops, or how if-elif-else statements work. GenAI will provide clear explanations to help you understand the concepts better.

**Request code examples** 
GenAI can generate Python code examples on demand. If you're unsure how to write a for loop to iterate through a list, just ask GenAI. It will provide a relevant code snippet with explanations, helping you learn by example.

**Get personalised practice questions**
GenAI can create practice Python questions tailored to your learning needs. Request questions on specific topics like dictionaries or functions, and GenAI will generate unique problems for you to solve. This personalised practice helps reinforce your understanding.

**Debug your code together**
When you encounter bugs in your Python code, GenAI can help you debug. Paste your code and error message, and ask GenAI to identify the issue. It will explain the problem and suggest fixes, helping you learn debugging skills experientially.

**Explore real-world weather applications**
GenAI can help you explore real-world applications of Python in weather data analysis. Ask for examples of how to use Python libraries like Matplotlib to visualise weather patterns or how to fetch weather data from APIs. GenAI will provide code snippets and explanations, bridging the gap between theory and practical application.

**Key Takeaways**

- GenAI can provide detailed explanations of Python programming concepts to clarify understanding.
