**Learning Objectives**

- Understand how to use functions within loops to modularize code
- Apply the concept of combining functions and loops to solve specific problems
- Recognize situations where using functions in loops can make code more efficient and maintainable

**Introduction**

This lesson builds upon the previous topics of loops and functions, showing how they can be combined effectively. It sets the stage for the next lesson on creating a robust weather app by applying these concepts.

**Detailed Presenter Notes**

**Key Takeaways**

- Functions can be called within loops to execute repetitive tasks with different parameters
- Combining functions and loops allows for more modular, reusable, and maintainable code
- By encapsulating specific functionality within functions, the main loop becomes more readable and easier to understand
- Using functions in loops can help avoid code duplication and make the program more efficient

**Quick Quiz**

1. What is the main benefit of using functions within loops?
   Answer: It allows for more modular, reusable, and maintainable code

2. How can using functions in loops make the main program more readable?
   Answer: By encapsulating specific functionality within functions, the main loop becomes more concise and easier to understand
