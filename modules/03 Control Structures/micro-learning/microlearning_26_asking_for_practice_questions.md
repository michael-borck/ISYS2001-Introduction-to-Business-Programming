**Learning Objectives**

- Demonstrate the use of AI tutoring tools to generate customized practice questions and projects focused on branching and repetition concepts.
- Apply knowledge of if-else statements, loops, and boolean expressions to solve weather-themed coding exercises.
- Identify and correct common errors in code snippets involving branching and looping structures.

**Introduction**

Following the introduction of branching, loops, and their application in weather-related examples, this lesson shows how AI can be leveraged to create targeted practice material. It leads into tips for effective AI use and a course project that ties together the concepts covered.

**"Generate 5 weather-themed 'if-else' questions"**
Ask the AI tutor to create a set of questions that test understanding of if-else statements in a weather context. For example: "Write an if-else statement that prints 'Bring an umbrella' if the weather is 'rainy', otherwise prints 'Leave the umbrella at home'."

**"Create loop exercises using temperature data"**
Request practice problems that involve iterating over temperature data using for or while loops. This could include calculating averages, finding min/max values, or counting days above/below a certain threshold.

**"Provide boolean expression practice with forecasts"**
Seek questions that combine weather forecasts with boolean operators and logical reasoning. For instance: "Write a boolean expression that evaluates to True if the forecast is 'sunny' and the temperature is above 20°C."

**"Design a mini-project: 7-day forecast analyzer"**
Challenge the AI to outline a small project that integrates branching and looping concepts. A 7-day forecast analyzer could involve storing daily weather data in a list or dictionary, then using loops and conditional statements to generate summary statistics or recommendations.

**"Craft debugging challenges for weather scripts"**
Ask for weather-related code snippets that contain intentional bugs or logical errors. Practising debugging reinforces understanding of how branching and repetition structures should work. The AI tutor can provide the broken code and challenge you to identify and fix the issues.

**Key Takeaways**

- AI tutoring tools can create targeted practice questions and projects to reinforce understanding of programming concepts like branching and repetition.
- Weather-related examples provide a relatable context for applying if-else statements, loops, and boolean expressions.
- Practicing with AI-generated exercises, including debugging challenges, helps solidify understanding of how branching and looping structures work.
- Integrating multiple programming concepts into mini-projects, such as a 7-day forecast analyzer, promotes deeper learning and problem-solving skills.

**Quick Quiz**

1. What is the primary benefit of using AI tutoring tools to generate practice questions?
   Answer: AI tutoring tools can create customized practice questions tailored to specific programming concepts and contexts.

2. How can weather-related examples help in learning branching and repetition concepts?
