**Learning Objectives**

- Understand how to combine if-elif-else statements with for and while loops
- Recognize situations where combining branching and repetition is useful
- Be able to write Python programs that use both branching and repetition together

**Introduction**



**Aim**
This lesson aims to show how branching and repetition can be combined in Python programs to create more powerful and flexible logic.

**Context**
Having covered branching with if-elif-else statements and repetition with for and while loops separately, this lesson demonstrates how these concepts can be used together. It leads into a practical example in the next lesson, "Weather Station Simulator".

**Key Takeaways**

- Branching and repetition can be nested inside each other to create more complex logic
- Loops can contain conditional statements to control the flow of the loop
- Conditional statements can contain loops to repeat code based on certain conditions
- Combining branching and repetition allows for more powerful and flexible programming
- Real-world applications often require a combination of branching and repetition

**Quick Quiz**

1. What is the main benefit of combining branching and repetition in a program?
   Answer: It allows for more powerful and flexible programming logic

2. Can loops contain conditional statements?
   Answer: Yes, loops can contain if-elif-else statements to control the flow of the loop

3. Can conditional statements contain loops?
   Answer: Yes, conditional statements can contain loops to repeat code based on certain conditions
