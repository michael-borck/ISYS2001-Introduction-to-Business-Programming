**Learning Objectives**

- Learners will be able to construct clear and specific requests to generative AI tools to obtain accurate and relevant assistance for their Python problems.
- Learners will be able to leverage generative AI tools to review and improve their own Python code solutions, focusing on efficiency, readability, and adherence to best practices.

**Introduction**

This lesson builds upon the previous discussion of using generative AI as a Python tutor and learning strategies. It offers concrete tips to help learners maximise the benefits of generative AI in their Python learning journey before introducing the course project.

**Be specific in your requests**
When seeking assistance from a generative AI tool, it's crucial to provide clear and precise instructions. Instead of asking broad, open-ended questions, break down your problem into smaller, well-defined components. Specify the desired output format, any constraints or requirements, and relevant context. This enables the AI to generate more accurate and relevant responses tailored to your needs.

**Start simple, then increase complexity**
When learning a new concept or working on a problem, begin with simple, straightforward requests to the AI. Once you have a solid grasp of the basics, gradually increase the complexity of your queries. This incremental approach allows you to build a strong foundation and prevents overwhelming you with intricate solutions right from the start. As you progress, challenge yourself with more advanced problems and leverage the AI's capabilities to explore different approaches and techniques.

**Ask for explanations of generated code**
When the AI generates code snippets or solutions, don't hesitate to ask for clarifications and explanations. Request the AI to provide comments or a step-by-step breakdown of how the code works. This helps you understand the logic behind the generated code and enhances your learning. By actively engaging with the AI's explanations, you can deepen your comprehension of Python concepts and programming patterns.

**Use GenAI to review your solutions**
After solving a problem or writing code on your own, utilise generative AI to review and provide feedback on your solution. Share your code with the AI and ask for suggestions on how to improve its efficiency, readability, or adherence to best practices. The AI can offer alternative approaches, point out potential issues, and suggest optimisations. This iterative process of coding and seeking feedback strengthens your problem-solving skills and helps you write cleaner, more robust code.

**Combine concepts in your practice requests**
As you progress in your Python learning, challenge yourself by combining multiple concepts in your practice requests to the AI. For example, ask the AI to create a program that involves both branching and repetition, or to design a function that incorporates data structures like dictionaries. By integrating various concepts, you can develop a more comprehensive understanding of how different Python elements work together. This holistic approach prepares you for tackling real-world problems that often require a combination of programming techniques.

**Key Takeaways**

- Provide clear and precise instructions to generative AI tools, breaking down problems into well-defined components for better results.
- Start with simple requests and gradually increase complexity to build a strong foundation and avoid overwhelming yourself.
- Ask the AI for explanations and step-by-step breakdowns of generated code to deepen your understanding of Python concepts.
- Use generative AI to review and provide feedback on your own code solutions, iteratively improving your problem-solving skills.
- Combine multiple Python concepts in your practice requests to develop a comprehensive understanding of how different elements work together.

**Quick Quiz**

1. What is the benefit of providing clear and precise instructions to generative AI tools when seeking assistance for Python problems?
   Answer: Providing clear and precise instructions enables the AI to generate more accurate and relevant responses tailored to your specific needs.

2. How can you use generative AI to improve your own Python code solutions?
   Answer: You can share your code with the AI and ask for suggestions on how to improve its efficiency, readability, or adherence to best practices. The AI can offer alternative approaches, point out potential issues, and suggest optimizations.
