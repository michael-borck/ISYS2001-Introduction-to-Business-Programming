## Part 1: Basic Concepts in Pseudocode

1. Write pseudocode for a program that suggests what to wear based on the temperature. If it's above 25°C, suggest light clothing. If it's between 15°C and 25°C, suggest a light jacket. If it's below 15°C, suggest warm clothing.

2. Create pseudocode for a program that checks if it's a good day for a picnic. It's a good day if it's not raining AND the temperature is between 20°C and 30°C.

3. Write pseudocode for a program that counts the number of rainy days in a week. Use a loop to check each day's weather condition.

4. Create pseudocode for a program that calculates the average temperature for a 5-day period. Use a loop to input temperatures and calculate the average.

5. Write pseudocode for a program that issues a heat wave warning. A heat wave is when the temperature is above 35°C for three consecutive days. Use a loop and counting mechanism.

## Part 2: Structuring English Descriptions into Pseudocode

6. Read the following paragraph and structure it into pseudocode:

   "A weather station needs to monitor air quality. It measures the Air Quality Index (AQI) every hour. If the AQI is above 150, it should trigger an alert. The station should continue monitoring until it has recorded 24 readings or until an alert has been triggered, whichever comes first."

7. Convert this weather forecasting process into pseudocode:

   "To predict tomorrow's weather, we look at today's temperature, humidity, and wind speed. If today's temperature is higher than yesterday's and the humidity is increasing, we predict a higher chance of rain. If the wind speed is also increasing, we predict stormy weather. Otherwise, if temperature and humidity are stable, we predict similar weather to today. We continue this process for a 7-day forecast."

8. Transform this severe weather alert system into pseudocode:

   "A severe weather alert system monitors temperature, wind speed, and precipitation. It issues different levels of alerts based on combinations of these factors. A 'Yellow Alert' is issued if any two of the following conditions are met: temperature above 35°C, wind speed above 60 km/h, or precipitation above 30 mm/hour. An 'Orange Alert' is issued if all three conditions are met. A 'Red Alert' is issued if any of the conditions are: temperature above 40°C, wind speed above 100 km/h, or precipitation above 50 mm/hour. The system checks conditions every 30 minutes and maintains the highest level alert until conditions improve."

## Part 3: Reflection and Analysis

9. Look back at your pseudocode for questions 6-8. Identify which parts were the most challenging to structure logically. Why do you think these were difficult?

10. For one of the complex scenarios (questions 6-8), list three questions you would ask a GenAI tutor to help you refine or improve your pseudocode solution.

11. Choose one of your pseudocode solutions and describe how you would extend it to handle more complex scenarios or additional weather factors.
