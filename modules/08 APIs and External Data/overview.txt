# Business Web and Mobile Technologies - Week 8: Web Scraping, APIs & External Data in Python

## 🎯 This Week's Focus
- Analyse the structure of JSON data returned by web APIs.
- Evaluate various authentication methods used for securing API access.
- Apply Python code to fetch and parse data from web APIs.
- Justify the selection of specific APIs based on data availability and reliability.
- Critique methods for handling network errors and exceptions in API calls.
- Design a feature for the Weather Dashboard that utilises real-time weather data.

## 📖 Before the Lab
- Module 1: Introduction to APIs and Web Scraping
- Module 2: Working with JSON Data in Python
- Module 3: Authentication Mechanisms for APIs
- Module 4: Error Handling in Network Requests

## 📝 Assessment
- Quiz: Key Concepts in API Usage and Web Scraping
