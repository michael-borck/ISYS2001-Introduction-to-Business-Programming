        "# Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "In this worksheet, you will create a simplified “weather calculator” that simulates processing weather data. This mini-project will help you:\n",
        "- Break a problem into smaller, manageable functions.\n",
        "- Reinforce the concept of returning values from functions.\n",
        "- Apply modular design principles, which will be useful when we later build a full weather dashboard.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Project Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "Your programme should allow the user to choose between two weather-related calculations:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Temperature Conversion:**  \n",
        "   Convert a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius.  \n",
        "   **Formula:**  \n",
        "   \\[\n",
        "   \\text{Celsius} = \\frac{(\\text{Fahrenheit} - 32) \\times 5}{9}\n",
        "   \\]\n",
        "   *Explanation:* Subtract 32 from the Fahrenheit temperature, multiply by 5, then divide by 9 to obtain the equivalent Celsius temperature.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Wind Chill Calculation:**  \n",
        "   Estimate the wind chill using a simplified version of the formula.  \n",
        "   **Formula:**  \n",
        "   \\[\n",
        "   \\text{Wind Chill} \\approx 35.74 + 0.6215 \\times T - 35.75 \\times V^{0.16} + 0.4275 \\times T \\times V^{0.16}\n",
        "   \\]\n",
        "   where:  \n",
        "   - \\( T \\) is the temperature in Fahrenheit  \n",
        "   - \\( V \\) is the wind speed in mph  \n",
        "   *Explanation:* This formula provides an estimate of how cold it feels when wind speed is taken into account along with the actual air temperature.\n",

        "# Your Task\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Plan Your Programme:**  \n",
        "   - Begin by writing pseudo-code to outline the steps:\n",
        "     - Display a menu for choosing between temperature conversion and wind chill calculation.\n",
        "     - Get the necessary inputs (temperature in Fahrenheit, and for wind chill, also wind speed).\n",
        "     - Perform the chosen calculation using the formulas provided.\n",
        "     - Return and display the result.\n",
        "   - **Tip:** Include comments in your pseudo-code to explain each step. This will help you organise your thoughts before writing the actual code.\n",
        "   - **AI Hint:** You can ask an AI assistant to help explain the formulas or generate a draft of pseudo-code. For example, try asking, \"Can you help me write pseudo-code for a function that converts Fahrenheit to Celsius?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Implement Your Code in Python:**  \n",
        "   - Convert your pseudo-code into Python code.\n",
        "   - **Important:** Ensure each function returns a value rather than printing it directly, where appropriate.\n",
        "   - Add comments throughout your code to explain what each section does.\n",
        "   - **AI Tip:** If you're unsure about the syntax or need help converting your pseudo-code into Python code, you can ask, \"Please convert this pseudo-code into Python code,\" and then paste your pseudo-code.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Test Your Programme:**  \n",
        "   - Use the worked examples above to test your final programme.\n",
        "   - Run your programme with the provided example inputs:\n",
        "     - Test with 68°F for temperature conversion.\n",
        "     - Test with 30°F and 10 mph for wind chill.\n",
        "   - Verify that the output matches the expected results.\n",
        "   - **AI Prompt:** You might ask, \"How can I test my Python programme with sample inputs?\" for additional guidance on testing techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Note:** We will discuss proper testing methods later in the semester. For now, these simple examples will help you verify that your programme works as expected.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Final Hint\n",
        "\n",
        "Keep in mind that the functions you write for this mini-project—such as converting temperatures and calculating wind chill—may be useful in your final assignment when you build a comprehensive weather dashboard. Modular design is a powerful tool that helps make your code reusable and easier to manage.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Reflection\n",
        "\n",
        "- How did breaking the problem into smaller functions help you manage the overall task?\n",
        "- Why is it beneficial for each function to return a value rather than printing directly?\n",
        "- How did writing pseudo-code first assist in planning your final programme?\n",
        "- How might AI tools assist you in explaining formulas, generating pseudo-code, or converting pseudo-code into Python code?\n",
        "\n",
        "Take your time to write your pseudo-code and then convert it into Python. This exercise is designed to reinforce modular design, returning values from functions, and problem decomposition—essential skills for your future projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Happy coding!"
