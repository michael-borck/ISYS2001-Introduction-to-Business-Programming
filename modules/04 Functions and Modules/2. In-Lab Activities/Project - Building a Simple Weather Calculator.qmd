# Introduction

In this worksheet, you will create a simplified “weather calculator” that simulates processing weather data. This mini-project will help you:
- Break a problem into smaller, manageable functions.
- Reinforce the concept of returning values from functions.
- Apply modular design principles, which will be useful when we later build a full weather dashboard.

# Project Overview

Your programme should allow the user to choose between two weather-related calculations:

1. **Temperature Conversion:**  
   Convert a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius.  
   **Formula:**  
   \[
   \text{Celsius} = \frac{(\text{Fahrenheit} - 32) \times 5}{9}
   \]
   *Explanation:* Subtract 32 from the Fahrenheit temperature, multiply by 5, then divide by 9 to obtain the equivalent Celsius temperature.

2. **Wind Chill Calculation:**  
   Estimate the wind chill using a simplified version of the formula.  
   **Formula:**  
   \[
   \text{Wind Chill} \approx 35.74 + 0.6215 \times T - 35.75 \times V^{0.16} + 0.4275 \times T \times V^{0.16}
   \]
   where:  
   - \( T \) is the temperature in Fahrenheit  
   - \( V \) is the wind speed in mph  
   *Explanation:* This formula provides an estimate of how cold it feels when wind speed is taken into account along with the actual air temperature.

# Worked Examples

Below are some worked examples that you can use to test your final programme.

## Example 1: Temperature Conversion

- **Input:** 68°F  
- **Calculation:**  
  \[
  \text{Celsius} = \frac{(68 - 32) \times 5}{9} = \frac{36 \times 5}{9} = \frac{180}{9} = 20^\circ\text{C}
  \]
- **Expected Output:**  
  "68°F is equivalent to 20.00°C."

## Example 2: Wind Chill Calculation

- **Input:** Temperature = 30°F, Wind Speed = 10 mph  
- **Calculation:**  
  \[
  \begin{aligned}
  \text{Wind Chill} &\approx 35.74 + 0.6215 \times 30 - 35.75 \times (10)^{0.16} + 0.4275 \times 30 \times (10)^{0.16} \\
  &\approx 35.74 + 18.645 - 35.75 \times 1.45 + 0.4275 \times 30 \times 1.45 \\
  &\approx 35.74 + 18.645 - 51.84 + 18.5775 \\
  &\approx 20.12^\circ\text{F}
  \end{aligned}
  \]
  *(Note: \(10^{0.16}\) is approximately 1.45.)*
- **Expected Output:**  
  "The wind chill is 20.12°F."

# Your Task

1. **Plan Your Programme:**  
   - Begin by writing pseudo-code to outline the steps:
     - Display a menu for choosing between temperature conversion and wind chill calculation.
     - Get the necessary inputs (temperature in Fahrenheit, and for wind chill, also wind speed).
     - Perform the chosen calculation using the formulas provided.
     - Return and display the result.
   - **Tip:** Include comments in your pseudo-code to explain each step. This will help you organise your thoughts before writing the actual code.
   - **AI Hint:** You can ask an AI assistant to help explain the formulas or generate a draft of pseudo-code. For example, try asking, "Can you help me write pseudo-code for a function that converts Fahrenheit to Celsius?"

2. **Implement Your Code in Python:**  
   - Convert your pseudo-code into Python code.
   - **Important:** Ensure each function returns a value rather than printing it directly, where appropriate.
   - Add comments throughout your code to explain what each section does.
   - **AI Tip:** If you're unsure about the syntax or need help converting your pseudo-code into Python code, you can ask, "Please convert this pseudo-code into Python code," and then paste your pseudo-code.

3. **Test Your Programme:**  
   - Use the worked examples above to test your final programme.
   - Run your programme with the provided example inputs:
     - Test with 68°F for temperature conversion.
     - Test with 30°F and 10 mph for wind chill.
   - Verify that the output matches the expected results.
   - **AI Prompt:** You might ask, "How can I test my Python programme with sample inputs?" for additional guidance on testing techniques.

> **Note:** We will discuss proper testing methods later in the semester. For now, these simple examples will help you verify that your programme works as expected.

# Final Hint

Keep in mind that the functions you write for this mini-project—such as converting temperatures and calculating wind chill—may be useful in your final assignment when you build a comprehensive weather dashboard. Modular design is a powerful tool that helps make your code reusable and easier to manage.

# Reflection

- How did breaking the problem into smaller functions help you manage the overall task?
- Why is it beneficial for each function to return a value rather than printing directly?
- How did writing pseudo-code first assist in planning your final programme?
- How might AI tools assist you in explaining formulas, generating pseudo-code, or converting pseudo-code into Python code?

Take your time to write your pseudo-code and then convert it into Python. This exercise is designed to reinforce modular design, returning values from functions, and problem decomposition—essential skills for your future projects.

Happy coding!
