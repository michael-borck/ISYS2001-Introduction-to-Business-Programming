## 📌 AI Models Comparison

| AI Model/Tool | Description | Text Gen. (Creative) | Text Gen. (Factual) | Coding (Python) | Context Window | Multimodal | Cost (API) | Data Privacy | Example Use Cases |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ChatGPT (OpenAI) | Large language model accessible via web interface and API. | High | High | Excellent | 8,192 tokens (GPT-3.5) / 32,768 tokens (GPT-4) | No (GPT-3.5) / Yes (GPT-4) | Varies (usage-based) | OpenAI data policies | Creative writing, chatbots, code generation, translation |
| Claude (Anthropic) | Large language model focused on helpful and harmless responses. | Medium | High | Good | 100,000 tokens | No | Varies (usage-based) | Anthropic data policies | Summarization, long-form content, legal documents, customer support |
| Gemini (Google) | Multimodal large language model integrated with Google services. | Medium | Very High | Good | Varies | Yes (text, images, code) | Varies (usage-based) | Google data policies | Fact-checking, research, image analysis, Google Docs integration |
| LLaMA (Meta AI) | Open-source large language model for research and development. | Medium | Medium | Good | Varies (model size dependent) | No | N/A (base model) | User-controlled (local) | Custom AI model development, research, fine-tuning |
| Phi (Microsoft) | Lightweight large language model designed for efficiency. | Medium | Medium | Good | Varies | No | N/A (base model) | User-controlled (local) | Edge AI applications, resource-constrained devices |
| Groq AI | Focuses on low-latency AI inference. | N/A | High (for specific tasks) | Limited | N/A | No | Varies (usage-based) | Groq data policies | Fast Q&A, API integrations, real-time applications |
| DeepSeek AI | Designed for research and complex problem-solving. | Medium | Very High (for specific domains) | Excellent | Varies | No | Varies (usage-based) | DeepSeek data policies | Scientific research, technical analysis, complex reasoning |

**Key Considerations:**

* **Context Window:**  Indicates how much previous text the model can consider. Larger windows enable better understanding of long conversations or documents.
* **Multimodal:**  Indicates the ability to process different data types (text, images, code).
* **Cost (API):**  Refers to the pricing for accessing the model via API.  Pricing models vary.
* **Data Privacy:**  Refers to the data handling practices of the provider.  Review their privacy policies.
* **LLaMA and Phi:** These are base models, not end-user applications.  They require technical expertise to use.  Ollama is a tool that helps run these models locally.
