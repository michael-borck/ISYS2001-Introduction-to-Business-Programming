## Making Your Python Code Clear and Readable

Welcome! 🎉

When writing code, **how** you format your output is just as important as **what** you print. Imagine reading a book without spaces between paragraphs—it would be confusing, right? The same idea applies to programming!

In this notebook, you'll learn how to:  

- ✅ Add **blank lines** to make your output easier to read  
- ✅ Print **multiple lines** using different techniques  
- ✅ Use **comments** to explain your code (just like adding notes in a notebook!)

💡 **Why does this matter?**  

- Blank lines help **organise** your output.  
- Comments help **explain** your code so that you (and others) can understand it later.  
- Writing clear, readable code is a skill that **every great programmer** develops over time!

Let's make your Python programs **clear, structured, and easy to read!** 🚀

# AI as an assistant!

Throughout this notebook, our aim isn’t simply to complete every exercise but to truly understand how the Python print() command works. Feel free to use AI as a tool to clarify concepts and support your learning, but remember that building a strong foundation in these basics is key. As tasks become more challenging, your intuitive grasp of the fundamentals will help you confidently interpret and apply AI suggestions.


# Section 1: Skipping a Line in Code

Skipping a line in the code without a print statement has no effect on the output. For example:

```python
print("Apple")

print("or Orange?")
```

**Output:**
```
Apple
or Orange?
```

What do you think is the result of running this code?  Have a guess and then run the cell.  Did the output match your expectations?

```{python}
print("How")

print("are")
print("you?")
```

> *Hint:* Consider how each `print()` creates a new line.



# Section 2: We Must Skip a Line

But what if I want a blank line? You might be wondering, "How can we print a blank line in Python?" It's easy! Just use the `print()` function without anything inside the parentheses.

Check this out:

```python
print("How")
print()
print("are")
print("you?")
```

**Output:**
```
How

are
you?
```

Notice how we left the second line blank!

Now, let's put this into practice. Rearrange the lines below to print:

```
Blank spaces matter
for clarity

and style!
```

> *Advanced Tip:* Think about the order in which the lines are printed and how blank lines affect the overall output.



# Section 3: Multiple Lines with One Function

Can we use just one `print()` function to print several lines? We've got two nifty tricks for you. Ready?

### First Trick: Using `\n` to Start a New Line

How does it work? Check this out:

```python
print("This is the first line.\nThis is the second line.")
```

**Output:**
```
This is the first line.
This is the second line.
```

Here, `\n` inside the string tells Python to jump to a new line and continue printing. Easy and efficient, right?

> *Tip:* Use this method when you want to embed newlines within a single string.



# Section 4: Economical Printing – Using Triple Quotes

Here's another cool trick Python has up its sleeve to print several lines at once: using three single (`'''`) or three double (`"""`) quotes.

```python
print('''My contact:
Email: your_name@gmail.com
Phone: +xx-1234-5678''')
```

**Output:**
```
My contact:
Email: your_name@gmail.com
Phone: +xx-1234-5678
```

*Advanced Note:* When using triple quotes, Python preserves the newlines exactly as you type them, which can be very handy for multi-line output.



# Section 5: Debugging Multiline String Errors

Let's tackle a challenge with a multi-line string. Notice the problematic code below:

**Target Output:**

```
To-Do List:
1. Complete Python exercise
2. Review coding concepts
3. Have a cuppa tea
```

**Problematic Code:**

> *Hint:* Consider how to correctly represent a multi-line string in Python. You might use `\n` or triple quotes.

> *Extension:* Write two answers, one uses `\n` and the other uses triple quotes.

```{python}
print('To-Do List:
1. Complete Python exercise
2. Review coding concepts
3. Have a cuppa tea')
```

# Section 6: Print a Python Poem

Instead of an inspirational quote, why not create a short poem about Python? Ask AI to write a 3- or 4-line poem about Python, then print the poem using one of these techniques:

- Using multiple `print()` functions  
- Using `\n` inside a single string  
- Using triple quotes  

Print the poem with the same formatting as shown below. For example, if AI gives you:

```
Python dances in lines of code,
A rhythm where logic is bestowed.
In every loop, a tale unfolds,
A world of wonder in each node.
```

Your output should match the format exactly.

> *Tip:* Choose the method you like best to print the poem.


# Section 7: Print a Personal Profile

Now, create a Python program to print a personal profile using a single `print()` function. Here's the target output:

```
Personal Profile:
Name: Alice Smith
Favourite Language: Python
Hobby: Coding and bushwalking
```

> *Note:* You still have three options available (multiple print statements, `\n`, or triple quotes), but try a different one from the previous challenge.

> *Tip:* Ensure the text format is exactly as shown above, with proper line breaks.



# Section 8: Comments

Before we end the notebook, let’s talk about the line of code that the program *ignores* comments!

Comments don’t affect the program but are crucial for readability. By explaining what each part of the code does, comments act like helpful notes, guiding developers through the logic.

> **Quick Rule:** In Python, start a line with `#` and it's a comment.

**Example:**

```python
# This line is a comment and won't be executed
print("Do you have any comment?")
```

**Output:**
```
Do you have any comment?
```

The line starting with `#` is ignored by the computer.

> *Quick Question:* Which symbol does Python use to comment out a line?



# Section 9: Writing Comments

Anna has recently learnt about multi-line programming in Python and has written a simple script that incorporates all the lessons she learnt:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
print()
print("This is the first line. \nThis is the second line.")
print('''Three quotes can be used also
to print multiple lines using a single print function''')
```

Now, she wants to add these three comments inside her code in the appropriate places:
- `print()` function will leave an empty line  
- `\n` is used to signal Python to start a new line  
- Three quotation marks can also print multiple lines  

Please fill in the blanks below and assist Susan in writing well-commented scripts that she will find easier to understand later.

> *Tip:* Think about where each comment would best explain the corresponding code functionality.

```python
print("Hello, World!")

print()

print("This is the first line. \nThis is the second line.")

print('''Three quotes can be used also
to print multiple lines using a single print function''')
```

Happy coding, and remember—clear and readable code is the first step towards becoming a great programmer!
