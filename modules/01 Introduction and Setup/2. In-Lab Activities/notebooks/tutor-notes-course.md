## Introduction & Purpose

This guide provides an overview of the course structure, expectations, and key workflows to support tutors in effectively guiding students through the learning process. It outlines:

- The **pedagogical approach** (flipped classroom, AI-assisted learning, and progressive difficulty).
- **Key workflows**, including Google Colab and GitHub usage.
- **AI expectations**, ensuring students engage meaningfully with AI tools.
- **Assessment structure**, including quizzes and project submissions.
- **Support resources** for tutors and students.

By following this guide, tutors can provide a consistent learning experience that helps students build a strong Python foundation while adapting to modern AI-assisted development workflows.

## Slow Start & Increasing Task Difficulty

The first three to four weeks of the course progress very slowly, which may feel frustrating for students with some programming experience. I’ll acknowledge this in class and apologise in advance to those students.

However, it’s crucial to establish a habit of engaging with the notebooks early. The first two to three weeks focus on sequence, selection, repetition, variables, and data types. While AI could generate answers for everything, students need to develop the discipline to use AI as a learning tool rather than just a shortcut to solutions.

Once we move beyond the basics, task difficulty will increase significantly. At that stage, students who have engaged consistently with the notebooks will have a more intuitive understanding of AI-generated code, making it easier to refine and apply in meaningful ways. This will be critical for success later in the course.

## Google Colab & GitHub Workflow
Students should follow this process to set up their workflow:

1. **Log into GitHub first.**
2. **Open the provided Colab notebook** (linked from the public GitHub repository).
3. **Use the “Open in Colab” button** to launch the notebook in their browser.
4. **Save a copy to their GitHub repository.** (Some students may need to run a cell before saving.)
5. **Confirm that their changes are properly saved in GitHub.**

This workflow will be used throughout the semester, so it’s crucial to establish it early.

## AI Usage & Expectations
AI is encouraged throughout the course, but students must demonstrate understanding rather than just copying AI-generated code. The primary goal is **learning and comprehension**, not just producing a working solution.

### AI Use in Assessments
- **Final projects allocate only 10-15% of marks to working code.**
- The majority of marks come from:
  - Proper use of GitHub.
  - Clear understanding of concepts.
  - Adherence to best practices in coding.
- **Copying AI-generated code without modifications is a baseline fail.** Students must refine AI output, ensuring it aligns with course standards.

AI usage guidelines are embedded throughout the course materials, and students will receive structured support on how to use AI effectively.

## Course Structure & Materials
This unit follows a **flipped classroom model** with AI-assisted learning. Weekly content is released progressively to keep materials aligned with the course pace and student engagement.

### Lecture & Lab Materials
- **Students engage with flipped content before labs.**
- Weekly lecture content is available in multiple formats:
  - **HTML** (with a table of contents for easy navigation).
  - **PowerPoint & PDF** (downloadable for offline use).
  - **Audio & Video** (Google NotebookLM generates a podcast version; a video version will follow).
- Students can choose the format that best suits their learning style.

### Traditional Lectures vs. Flipped Model
- If you are running a **traditional lecture**, use the **“Before the Lab”** materials.
- This content is designed to function as a **mini-lecture split into 2-4 sections** for better engagement.

## Tutor Notes & Weekly Quizzes
- **Tutor notes** for each week are uploaded to the STAFF-MATERIAL section on Blackboard.
- If anything is unclear or missing, please let me know.

### Lab Exit Quizzes
- **Required for the first eight weeks.**
- **Access:** The quiz activates at the end of the scheduled lab session.
- **Restrictions:**
  - Access is controlled via Blackboard groups.
  - IP filtering ensures students complete it in their designated lab.
  - (For the first few weeks, quizzes may remain open for longer to resolve technical issues.)
- **Encourage students to complete the quiz independently**, using AI if needed.
- Quizzes can be attempted multiple times.

## Project & Notebook Submission
- **Students do not submit weekly notebooks.**
- Notebooks are for **learning purposes** but contribute to the final project.
- **Lab sessions introduce notebooks,** but students are expected to complete unfinished work independently.

**Expected Weekly Time Commitment:**
- **Total: ~10 hours per unit per week.**
  - **Contact Hours:** ~3 hours (labs + support).
  - **Independent Study:** ~7 hours (review, practice, and research).

Encourage students to **pace themselves and engage actively** with the material, rather than just focusing on task completion.
