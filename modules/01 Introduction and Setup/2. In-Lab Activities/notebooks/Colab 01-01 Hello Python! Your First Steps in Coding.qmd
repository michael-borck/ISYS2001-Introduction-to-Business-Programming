# Introduction
Welcome to your first Python notebook! 🎉

This notebook will guide you through writing and debugging your first Python program.

Follow the instructions, fill in the blanks, and execute the code cells to see Python in action!

> 💡 **AI Tip:** If you're unsure about an answer, try your best first. Then, ask AI for a suggestion and compare your attempt with AI's response. Consider which is clearer and easier to understand.

# Section 1: Printing "Hello World!"

## Example:
print("Hello World!")

## Task: Print "Hello World!"
Your mission: Copy the code above and print "Hello World!" to see your first output in action.

```{python}
print("  ")
```

> 💡 **AI Tip:** If your code doesn’t work, copy the error message and ask AI to explain it in simple terms.

# Section 2: Understanding print() Function

Think of `print()` as a magic spell 🧙‍♂️ that makes text appear on the screen. Now, print another message to cast your magic spell.

## Task: Print another message of your choice

> 💡 **Hint:** Replace the blank space inside the quotes with any text you want to see on the screen.

```{python}
print("  ")
```

# Section 3: Printing Multiple Lines

When you use multiple `print()` statements, each one creates a new line on your screen. First, predict what the output will be before running the code below.

```{python}
print("Hello World!")
print("I am learning Python.")
```

What was printed? Is it what you expected?

>💡 **AI Tip:** If you're unsure about your output, try asking AI: *What will this Python code output?*

## Task: Print two messages on separate lines

Time to level up your printing skills! Use two print statements to display:

- Python is versatile!
- I am learning Python!

```{python}
print(" ")
print(" ")
```

🎉 Congratulations! You've completed your first Python worksheet.
Experiment with what you've learned and explore AI-powered debugging!
