### Introduction for Tutors

Welcome to your tutor guide for Week 1! The purpose of these notes is to provide you with background information, key learning outcomes, and a suggested timeline for delivering the material. Please note that, for this week, the tasks are very basic, and the instructions provided in the student notebooks are detailed and self-explanatory. As such, a separate staff version of the notebooks has not been created. Your role is to support and facilitate student learning, ensuring that everyone builds a solid foundation in Python fundamentals.

### Background & Preparation

- **Accounts Setup:**  
  Ensure all students have created both a Google account and a GitHub account prior to the lab. These accounts are **critical** for accessing course materials and submitting assignments throughout the course.

- **Flipped Content Overview:**  
  Normally, students are expected to complete the flipped content before coming to lab. Since this is the first week, dedicate the first **5 minutes** of the session to explain the flipped learning model and emphasise that, from Week 2 onward, pre-lab preparation is mandatory.

- **Pacing:**  
  The first 3–4 weeks are intentionally slow-paced to establish a strong grasp of fundamental programming concepts, such as:
  - **Sequence:** The order in which code executes.
  - **Selection:** The use of conditional statements (if-elif-else).
  - **Repetition:** Looping constructs (e.g., while loops).
  - **Data and Values:** Understanding basic data types in Python.



### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this session, students should be able to:
- Use the Python `print()` function to produce output.
- Identify and fix basic syntax and formatting errors in Python code.
- Write clean, readable code by effectively using formatting, blank lines, and comments.
- Modify a simple AI Chatbot script to personalise its responses.
- Appreciate the evolution from static output (using `print()`) to more interactive programming approaches.



### Two-Hour Lab Session – Suggested Timings

1. **Introduction & Flipped Content Overview (5 minutes):**  
   - Explain the flipped classroom model.
   - Stress that all subsequent weeks require pre-lab content completion.

2. **Accounts Check (10 minutes):**  
   - Verify that all students have set up their Google and GitHub accounts.

3. **Worksheet 1: Hello Python (15 minutes):**  
   - Walk through the "Hello Python" notebook.
   - Demonstrate code execution and address any questions.

4. **Worksheet 2: Fixing Mistakes (15 minutes):**  
   - Guide students in identifying and correcting errors.
   - Emphasise reading error messages and using AI for clarifications if needed.

5. **Worksheet 3: Making Code Clear and Readable (15 minutes):**  
   - Highlight the importance of formatting and commenting.
   - Allow time for students to experiment with different formatting options.

6. **Project: Simple AI Chatbot (20 minutes):**  
   - Introduce the starter code and review the conversation flow.
   - Discuss modification tasks, encouraging creativity and personalisation.
   - Remind students that the focus is on mastering the `print()` function and building a strong foundation.

7. **Optional Extension Activity (Optional, 5 minutes):**  
   - Briefly present the advanced extension section.
   - Stress that this section is entirely optional and intended for those curious about more advanced concepts.
   - Reiterate that the fundamentals must be mastered first.
   - complete in own time as required

8. **Wrap-Up & Q&A & Quiz (10 minutes):**  
   - Summarise key concepts covered in the session.
   - Open the floor for questions and clarifications.
   - Remind students to complete the flipped content before the next lab session.
   - **Lab Exit Quiz (5 mins)**
      - Active in the last 30 mins of the sessison (maybe discuss earlier)
      - log in and Complete the Quiz
      - Work Independently (using AI is ok)
      - Submit on Time
      - Can redo the quiz as many times as they like




### Additional Notes for Tutors

- **Emphasise Fundamentals:**  
  Although the tasks are simple, the goal is to build a solid understanding of the basics. Encourage students to work through problems on their own before relying on AI for answers.

- **Friendly and Supportive Tone:**  
  Use humour and relatable examples to keep the session engaging. Reinforce that making mistakes is a natural part of learning.

- **Pacing and Interaction:**  
  Monitor student progress carefully. Some may require more time on certain sections, so be prepared to revisit concepts as needed. Encourage active participation and discussion.

- **Extension Activity Caution:**  
  Remind students that the optional extension activity is only for those who are curious about more advanced topics. Make it clear that the primary focus is on mastering the fundamentals through the basic exercises.

- **Lab Exit Quiz**
  During the final 30 minutes of the lab session, the lab exit quiz will become active. This is a multiple-choice quiz designed to assess the students' understanding of the material covered in today's session. Please instruct the students to:

  - Log in and Complete the Quiz: Ensure they have access to the quiz platform (via their Google/GitHub accounts if applicable) and that they complete all the questions before the lab ends.
  - Work Independently: Remind students that the quiz is an individual assessment. Encourage them to rely on their understanding of the concepts rather than external help during this time.
  - Submit on Time: Emphasise that the quiz is timed and must be submitted before the session concludes.
  - Redo the quiz as many time as they like

By following these guidelines, you'll help ensure that students build a robust foundation in Python programming while staying engaged and motivated for future, more challenging tasks.

Happy teaching!
