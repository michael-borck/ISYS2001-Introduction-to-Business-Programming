# A Flipped Classroom Approach!

- Watch short tutorials before class
- Code during class with guidance
- Collaborate with peers
- Immediate feedback for better learning

::: {.notes}
In this flipped classroom approach, students watch short tutorial videos before class to gain a foundational understanding of the concepts. Class time is then dedicated to coding practice with guidance from the instructor, allowing for immediate feedback and clarification of any questions. This active learning approach promotes better retention and application of the material.

Collaboration with peers is also encouraged in this flipped classroom model. Students work together during class to solve problems and share insights, fostering a supportive learning environment. The combination of self-paced tutorials, hands-on coding practice, and peer collaboration creates a well-rounded learning experience that caters to different learning styles and provides immediate feedback for optimal growth.
:::

# Tools You'll Use

- **Google Colab** – Cloud-based Python coding
- **GitHub** – Version control & collaboration (track changes, work together)
- **Class Resources** – Guides, videos, and exercises

::: {.notes}
In this slide, we will introduce the key tools you'll be using throughout the course. Google Colab is a cloud-based Python coding environment that allows you to write and run Python code directly in your web browser, making it easy to get started without the need for local setup. GitHub is a version control and collaboration platform that enables you to track changes to your code, work together with others on projects, and manage your codebase effectively.

Finally, we'll provide you with a range of class resources, including guides, videos, and exercises, to support your learning journey. These resources are designed to help you grasp the concepts, apply them in practice, and reinforce your understanding of Python programming for business applications.

# Active Learning for Lasting Results

- Hands-on learning boosts retention
- Read less, do more
- Build confidence, not frustration

::: {.notes}
Active learning is a powerful approach that emphasises hands-on engagement and practical application, resulting in improved retention of knowledge. By prioritising active participation over passive reading, learners develop a deeper understanding of the subject matter and build confidence in their abilities. This approach minimises frustration by providing opportunities for practical experience and real-world problem-solving.

Incorporating active learning strategies, such as hands-on projects, coding exercises, and collaborative activities, creates a dynamic and engaging learning environment. Learners are encouraged to apply their knowledge in meaningful ways, reinforcing key concepts and developing practical skills. By focusing on active participation, learners are better equipped to tackle real-world challenges and develop a strong foundation in the subject matter.

# AI as Your Coding Assistant

- AI can help you generate and refine code (e.g., suggest better ways to write your code)
- Use AI for debugging and optimisation (e.g., help you find and fix errors)
- AI-assisted learning boosts efficiency

::: {.notes}
AI can help you write better code, find and fix errors, and boost your efficiency as a programmer. It can suggest improvements to your code, assist with debugging, and provide optimisation recommendations.

Leveraging AI as your coding assistant is a powerful way to accelerate your learning and development process. By using AI-powered tools, you can get real-time feedback, quickly identify and resolve issues, and ultimately write higher-quality code in less time.

# Best Practices for Learning

- Use a **physical keyboard** (not mobile devices)
- Pay attention to **syntax and formatting** (e.g., proper indentation makes your code easier to read)
- Follow industry standards for clean code

::: {.notes}
Using a physical keyboard, rather than mobile devices, can significantly improve your coding experience and productivity. A full-size keyboard allows for faster and more accurate typing, which is crucial when working with complex code structures. Additionally, using a physical keyboard reduces the likelihood of making errors caused by small screen sizes and touch input on mobile devices.

Paying attention to syntax and formatting, such as proper indentation, is essential for writing clean and readable code. Following industry standards for code formatting not only makes your code easier to understand for yourself but also for other developers who may work with your code in the future. Well-formatted code is more maintainable, reduces the likelihood of errors, and demonstrates professionalism in your work.
:::

# Study, Practice, Rest!

- Study a topic for 5-10 min
- Practise coding for 10-15 min
- Take breaks to absorb learning

::: {.notes}
To maximise your learning effectiveness, employ a structured approach of focused study sessions, coding practice, and rest breaks. Begin by dedicating 5-10 minutes to studying a specific topic, ensuring you grasp the fundamental concepts and principles. Follow this with 10-15 minutes of hands-on coding practice, applying the knowledge you've just acquired to solidify your understanding through practical implementation.

Equally important to the study and practice sessions are the breaks in between. These intervals allow your brain to process and absorb the new information, facilitating the transfer of knowledge from short-term to long-term memory. By striking a balance between focused learning and restorative rest, you optimise your cognitive performance and enhance your overall learning outcomes.
