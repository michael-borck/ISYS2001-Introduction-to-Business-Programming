# Introduction to Business Programming - Week 7: Business Data Processing

## 🎯 This Week's Focus
- Analyse various data structures to optimise information retrieval for business solutions.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of pandas library functions in data manipulation tasks.
- Apply Python programming to create and manipulate complex data structures.
- Justify the use of specific data processing techniques in the context of generating accurate weather reports.
- Critique the design of a data processing algorithm to ensure efficiency and reliability in real-world applications.
- Synthesise knowledge from previous weeks to enhance the functionality of the ongoing weather application project.

## 📖 Before the Lab
- Module 1: Introduction to pandas for Data Processing
- Module 2: Advanced Data Structures in Python
- Module 3: Evaluating Data Processing Techniques in Business Contexts

## 📝 Assessment
- Self-Assessment Quiz: Understanding pandas and Data Structures
- Peer Review: Evaluate and Provide Feedback on Classmate's Data Processing Code
- Short Analysis Task: Critique a Provided Data Algorithm's Efficiency and Business Relevance

## 🛠 Workshop Activities
- Exploring pandas Basics (Skill focus: Applying concepts)
- Data Analysis with pandas (Skill focus: Analysing data)
