MC	What is the primary purpose of data structures in Python programming?	To organize and manage data efficiently, enabling the selection of the most appropriate storage and access methods for optimal code performance.	correct	To solely store data in a sequential manner.	incorrect	To enhance the visual appeal of code.	incorrect	To limit the types of data that can be used in a program.	incorrect
MC	Which of the following is NOT a core data structure in Python?	Arrays	correct	Lists	incorrect	Tuples	incorrect	Dictionaries	incorrect
MC	Which characteristic best describes Python lists?	Ordered and mutable collections of items of potentially different data types.	correct	Unordered and immutable collections of unique items.	incorrect	Unordered collections of key-value pairs.	incorrect	Ordered collections of unique, immutable items.	incorrect
MC	What is the key difference between Python lists and tuples?	Lists are mutable, while tuples are immutable.	correct	Lists are unordered, while tuples are ordered.	incorrect	Lists can only contain numbers, while tuples can contain any data type.	incorrect	Lists are faster than tuples for all operations.	incorrect
MC	Why are Python dictionaries efficient for data lookup?	They use hashing to directly access values associated with keys.	correct	They are always sorted alphabetically.	incorrect	They only store numerical data.	incorrect	They are inherently faster than any other data structure.	incorrect
MC	Which of the following is NOT a common operation performed with Python sets?	Sorting elements in a specific order.	correct	Finding common elements (intersection).	incorrect	Combining elements (union).	incorrect	Checking for element presence (membership testing).	incorrect
MC	When should you choose a tuple over a list in Python?	When you need an ordered collection that should remain unchanged after creation.	correct	When you need to frequently add or remove elements.	incorrect	When the order of elements is not important.	incorrect	When you need to store only numerical data.	incorrect
MC	Which of these statements accurately describes Python sets?	Unordered collections of unique, immutable elements.	correct	Ordered collections of unique, mutable elements.	incorrect	Ordered collections of potentially duplicate, immutable elements.	incorrect	Unordered collections of potentially duplicate, mutable elements.	incorrect
MC	What is a key characteristic of Python dictionaries?	They are unordered collections of key-value pairs with unique, immutable keys.	correct	They are ordered collections of key-value pairs with mutable keys.	incorrect	They only store numerical values.	incorrect	They are immutable collections.	incorrect
MC	How do you create an empty Python dictionary?	`my_dict = {}`	correct	`my_dict = []`	incorrect	`my_dict = ()`	incorrect	`my_dict = ""`	incorrect
MC	How would you access the value associated with the key "name" in the dictionary `person = {"name": "Alex", "age": 30}`?	`person["name"]`	correct	`person.name`	incorrect	`person[0]`	incorrect	`person.get("age")`	incorrect
MC	Which method is used to safely access a value in a Python dictionary, providing a default if the key is not found?	`get()`	correct	`pop()`	incorrect	`add()`	incorrect	`update()`	incorrect
MC	How can you add a new key-value pair to an existing Python dictionary?	Assign a value to a new key using `dictionary_name[new_key] = new_value`.	correct	Use the `append()` method.	incorrect	Use the `insert()` method.	incorrect	Modify an existing key's value directly.	incorrect
MC	What does the `items()` method return when used with a Python dictionary?	A view object containing all key-value pairs as tuples.	correct	Only the keys of the dictionary.	incorrect	Only the values of the dictionary.	incorrect	The length of the dictionary.	incorrect
MC	Which built-in method would you use to merge two Python dictionaries?	`update()`	correct	`append()`	incorrect	`extend()`	incorrect	`merge()`	incorrect
MC	What are nested dictionaries in Python?	Dictionaries containing other dictionaries as values.	correct	Dictionaries with only numerical values.	incorrect	Dictionaries that are sorted alphabetically.	incorrect	Dictionaries that are immutable.	incorrect
MC	What makes Python dictionaries versatile?	Their ability to store unordered key-value pairs with efficient retrieval, mutable nature, support for diverse value types, built-in methods, and capacity for nesting.	correct	Their inherent ordering and immutability.	incorrect	Their limitation to only storing numerical data.	incorrect	Their slow lookup times.	incorrect
