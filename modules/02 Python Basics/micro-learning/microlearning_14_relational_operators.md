**Learning Objectives**

- Understand what relational operators are and their purpose in programming
- Learn the different types of relational operators and their syntax
- Be able to use relational operators in conditional statements and loops

**Introduction**



**Aim**
The aim of this lesson is to introduce relational operators and their role in programming.

**Context**
This lesson follows on from the discussion of operators in general. It leads into the next lesson which tests the audience's understanding of the concepts covered.

**Key Takeaways**

- Relational operators compare two values and return a boolean result (true or false)
- The main relational operators are: equality (==), inequality (!=), greater than (>), less than (<), greater than or equal to (>=), and less than or equal to (<=)
- Relational operators are essential for controlling the flow of a program through conditional statements and loops
- The result of a relational operation can be assigned to a variable or used directly in an if statement or loop condition

**Quick Quiz**

1. What is the result of the following expression: 5 > 3?
   Answer: true

2. Which relational operator checks if two values are not equal?
   Answer: !=

3. Is the following statement true or false: 7 <= 7?
   Answer: true
