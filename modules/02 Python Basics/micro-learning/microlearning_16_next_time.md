**Learning Objectives**

- Understand how to use control structures such as if-else statements and switch-case statements to make decisions in a program.
- Learn how to use loops, including for loops and while loops, to control the flow of a program and repeat code blocks.
- Apply decision-making and looping concepts to create more dynamic, interactive, and efficient programs.

**Introduction**

After introducing fundamental concepts like problem-solving, pseudocode, variables, and operators, this lesson serves as a glimpse into the upcoming topics. It bridges the gap between the basic building blocks and the more advanced programming concepts that enable students to create functional programs.

**Making decisions**
In the next lesson, we will explore how computers make decisions based on certain conditions using control structures such as if-else statements and switch-case statements. These concepts allow programmers to create programs that can respond differently based on user input or other variables, enabling more dynamic and interactive software.

**Controlling the flow of a program** 
We will also discuss how to control the flow of a program using loops, such as for loops and while loops. These structures allow programmers to repeat a block of code multiple times, either for a specified number of iterations or until a certain condition is met. By mastering these concepts, students will be able to create more efficient and powerful programs.

**Key Takeaways**

- Control structures allow computers to make decisions based on certain conditions.
- If-else statements and switch-case statements enable programs to respond differently based on user input or other variables.
- Loops, such as for loops and while loops, allow programmers to repeat a block of code multiple times.
- Mastering decision-making and looping concepts is essential for creating more efficient and powerful programs.
