**Learning Objectives**

- Identify and differentiate between the four main types of values: integers, floats, characters, and booleans.
- Understand the purpose and uses of each value type in programming.
- Recognize the importance of selecting the appropriate value type for a given task.

**Introduction**

This lesson follows on from the discussion of problem-solving methodology and pseudocode. It provides a foundation for understanding variables and operators, which will be covered in the subsequent lessons.

**Single Value** A single value is the simplest type of data that can be stored in a program. It represents a single piece of information, such as a number or a character. Single values are the building blocks of more complex data structures.

**Integer (count)** An integer is a whole number that can be positive, negative, or zero. Integers are commonly used for counting and indexing. They are represented by a fixed number of bits, which determines the range of values they can store.

**Float (measure)** A float, short for floating-point number, is used to represent decimal numbers. Floats are useful for measuring and calculating values that require precision, such as distances or weights. They are stored using a mantissa and an exponent, allowing for a wide range of values.

**Character** A character is a single letter, digit, punctuation mark, or symbol. Characters are typically represented by a single byte of memory and are used for storing and manipulating text data. They can be combined to form strings, which are sequences of characters.

**Boolean** A boolean is a data type that can have only two possible values: true or false. Booleans are used for logical operations and decision-making in programs. They are essential for controlling the flow of execution based on certain conditions.

**Key Takeaways**

- Single values are the simplest type of data that can be stored in a program.
- Integers are used for counting and indexing, while floats are used for measuring and calculating values that require precision.
- Characters represent single letters, digits, punctuation marks, or symbols and can be combined to form strings.
- Booleans are used for logical operations and decision-making, with only two possible values: true or false.
