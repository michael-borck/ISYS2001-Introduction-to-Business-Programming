**Learning Objectives**

- Understand how pseudocode is used to outline the logic and structure of a program
- Recognize the application of the six basic operations in a pseudocode example
- Identify the use of variables in a pseudocode example

**Introduction**



**Aim**
This lesson aims to provide a concrete example of pseudocode to illustrate the concepts discussed in the previous lesson.

**Context**
Following the introduction to pseudocode, this lesson offers a practical demonstration of how pseudocode can be used to outline the logic and structure of a program. The example will help learners understand the application of the six basic operations and the use of variables, which will be covered in subsequent lessons.

**Key Takeaways**

- Pseudocode is a useful tool for planning and communicating the logic of a program
- The six basic operations (input, output, processing, decision, repetition, and storage) are essential components of pseudocode
- Variables are used in pseudocode to store and manipulate data
- Pseudocode examples help bridge the gap between concept and implementation

**Quick Quiz**

1. What is the primary purpose of using pseudocode?
   Answer: To outline the logic and structure of a program

2. Which of the following is not one of the six basic operations in pseudocode?
   Answer: Debugging
