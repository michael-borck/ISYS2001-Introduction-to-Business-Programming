**Aim**
This lesson aims to introduce a structured approach to problem-solving in the context of AI and machine learning.

**Context**
Having discussed the importance of problem-solving skills, this lesson breaks down a step-by-step methodology that can be applied to tackle challenges in AI and machine learning. The subsequent lessons will elaborate on some of these steps, such as stating the problem clearly and using pseudocode.

**State the problem clearly** Before attempting to solve a problem, it is crucial to have a clear understanding of what the problem is. This involves identifying the key issues, constraints, and desired outcomes. By stating the problem clearly, you can focus your efforts on finding the most appropriate solution.

**Describe the input and output** To develop an effective algorithm, you need to define the expected inputs and outputs. This includes specifying the data types, formats, and any constraints or assumptions. By clearly describing the input and output, you can ensure that your solution is compatible with the problem requirements.

**Work a simple example by hand** Before diving into complex algorithms, it is helpful to work through a simple example by hand. This allows you to break down the problem into smaller steps and gain a better understanding of the logic required. By manually solving a simple case, you can identify patterns and develop insights that will inform your algorithm design.

**Develop an algorithm** With a clear problem statement and an understanding of the inputs and outputs, you can now develop an algorithm to solve the problem. This involves outlining the step-by-step process for transforming the input into the desired output. The algorithm should be designed to handle various scenarios and edge cases efficiently.

**Convert to Python (or some other language)** Once you have developed an algorithm, the next step is to implement it in a programming language such as Python. This involves translating the algorithmic steps into code, taking into account the specific syntax and libraries of the chosen language. It is important to write clean, well-documented code that accurately reflects the algorithm.

**Test solution with a variety of data** After implementing the solution, it is crucial to test it with a diverse range of input data. This includes both typical cases and edge cases to ensure that the algorithm performs as expected. Testing helps identify any bugs, limitations, or areas for optimization. By thoroughly testing the solution, you can have confidence in its robustness and reliability.
