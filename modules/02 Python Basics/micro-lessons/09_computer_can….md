**Aim**
The aim of this lesson is to introduce the fundamental capabilities of computers in storing data and executing instructions.

**Context**
Having discussed problem-solving methodologies and pseudocode, this lesson transitions to the basic building blocks of computer programming. It lays the foundation for subsequent lessons on values, variables, and operators.

**Store Values**
Computers have the ability to store and retrieve data in their memory. This data can be in various forms such as numbers, text, or images. The computer allocates a specific location in its memory to hold each piece of data, allowing it to be accessed and manipulated as needed. Storing values is a crucial aspect of computer programming, as it enables the preservation and utilisation of data throughout the execution of a program.

**Perform Operations**
In addition to storing data, computers can execute a set of instructions, known as operations or computations, on that data. These operations can be arithmetic (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division), logical (comparisons and conditional statements), or manipulations of the stored values (like combining or splitting text). By performing these operations, computers can process and transform data, solve complex problems, and generate meaningful outputs based on the provided instructions and data.
