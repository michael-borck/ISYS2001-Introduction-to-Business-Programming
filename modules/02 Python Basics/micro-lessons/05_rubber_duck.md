**Aim**
Introduce the concept of "rubber duck debugging" as a problem-solving technique in programming.

**Context**
This lesson follows the "Problem Solving Methodology" and "State the Problem Clearly" lessons, providing a specific technique for addressing programming issues. It precedes the "Psuedocode" and "Psuedocode Example" lessons, which present another approach to problem-solving in programming.

**Bullet Point 1**
Rubber duck debugging is a technique where programmers explain their code, line by line, to an inanimate object, such as a rubber duck. This process helps them identify errors, inconsistencies, or areas for improvement in their code. By articulating the purpose and functionality of each line, programmers can often spot issues they might have overlooked during the coding process.

**Bullet Point 2**
The concept of rubber duck debugging is derived from a story in the book "The Pragmatic Programmer" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. In the book, a programmer carries around a rubber duck and explains his code to it, helping him solve problems more effectively. This anecdote has become a well-known reference in the programming community.

**Bullet Point 3**
Rubber duck debugging is a simple yet powerful technique that can be used by programmers of all skill levels. It encourages a systematic and thoughtful approach to problem-solving, as the act of explaining code step-by-step can help reveal gaps in logic or understanding. This technique can be particularly useful when dealing with complex or stubborn bugs.

**Bullet Point 4**
While the term "rubber duck debugging" specifically refers to the use of a rubber duck, the concept can be applied using any inanimate object or even a willing colleague. The key is to verbally explain the code in detail, as if teaching it to someone else. This process of externalization can help programmers better understand their own code and identify areas for improvement.
