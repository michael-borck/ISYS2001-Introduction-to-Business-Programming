**Aim**
This lesson aims to preview the key programming concepts that will be covered in the next lesson.

**Context**
After introducing fundamental concepts like problem-solving, pseudocode, variables, and operators, this lesson serves as a glimpse into the upcoming topics. It bridges the gap between the basic building blocks and the more advanced programming concepts that enable students to create functional programs.

**Making decisions**
In the next lesson, we will explore how computers make decisions based on certain conditions using control structures such as if-else statements and switch-case statements. These concepts allow programmers to create programs that can respond differently based on user input or other variables, enabling more dynamic and interactive software.

**Controlling the flow of a program** 
We will also discuss how to control the flow of a program using loops, such as for loops and while loops. These structures allow programmers to repeat a block of code multiple times, either for a specified number of iterations or until a certain condition is met. By mastering these concepts, students will be able to create more efficient and powerful programs.
