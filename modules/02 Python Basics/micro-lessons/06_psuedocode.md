**Aim**
The purpose of this lesson is to introduce pseudocode as a tool for outlining the logic and steps of a solution to a problem, without being tied to specific programming language syntax.

**Context**
This lesson follows on from discussing problem-solving methodologies and precedes an example of pseudocode in action. It sits within the broader context of the presentation covering fundamental concepts in AI and machine learning, such as values, variables and operators.

**List the steps** Pseudocode involves listing out the sequential steps needed to solve a problem or implement an algorithm. By breaking down the solution into clear, ordered steps, it helps to clarify the logic and flow of the approach.

**Use short phrases (make it easier to convert)** When writing pseudocode, use concise, simple language rather than complete sentences. Short phrases make the pseudocode more readable and easier to convert into actual programming language code later on.

**No Syntax or rules** Pseudocode does not adhere to the strict syntax rules of programming languages. This allows the focus to remain on expressing the logic and sequence of the solution without getting bogged down in language specifics.

**Not a language (not compiled or executed)** Pseudocode is not an actual programming language that can be compiled or run. Its purpose is to communicate and plan the logic of a program in a human-readable way, not to be machine executable.

**Communication tool** One of the key roles of pseudocode is as a tool for communicating ideas between developers, team members and stakeholders. It provides a common language to discuss the logic and approach of a solution without requiring technical programming knowledge.

**Logic of the solution** Pseudocode captures the algorithmic thinking behind a solution - the logical steps, decisions, iterations, etc. It describes what needs to be done to solve the problem, rather than how to do it in a specific language.

**Translate into a programming language** Once the logic of a solution has been planned out in pseudocode, the next step is converting it into a chosen programming language. The pseudocode acts as a blueprint to guide the actual coding process.
