**Aim**
Introduce the six fundamental operations that computers can perform, which form the basis for all computational tasks.

**Context**
Having discussed problem-solving methodologies and pseudocode, this lesson focuses on the core capabilities of computers. It sets the stage for the following lessons, which delve into values, variables, and operators.

**Receive Information**
Computers can accept input from various sources, such as keyboards, mice, touchscreens, or sensors. This allows them to gather data and instructions necessary for processing. Input can be in the form of text, numbers, or even binary data.

**Output Information**
After processing data, computers can display results or send information to external devices. Common output methods include displaying text or graphics on a screen, printing documents, playing audio, or transmitting data over networks.

**Perform Arithmetic**
Computers excel at mathematical calculations. They can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with incredible speed and accuracy. These operations are fundamental to many computational tasks.

**Assign a value to a variable**
Variables are used to store and reference data in a program. Computers can assign specific values to variables, allowing for efficient data management and manipulation. This enables programs to keep track of changing data throughout execution.

**Compare to variables**
Computers can compare the values of two or more variables using relational operators. This allows for decision-making in programs, such as determining equality, greater than, or less than relationships between variables. Comparisons are crucial for controlling program flow and implementing conditional logic.

**Repeat a group of actions.**
Computers can execute a set of instructions repeatedly using loops. This allows for efficient processing of large amounts of data or performing iterative tasks. Loops enable computers to automate repetitive operations, saving time and effort compared to manual execution.
