**Aim**
This lesson aims to provide a concrete example of pseudocode to illustrate the concepts discussed in the previous lesson.

**Context**
Following the introduction to pseudocode, this lesson offers a practical demonstration of how pseudocode can be used to outline the logic and structure of a program. The example will help learners understand the application of the six basic operations and the use of variables, which will be covered in subsequent lessons.
