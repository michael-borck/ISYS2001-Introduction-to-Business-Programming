**Aim**
The aim of this lesson is to introduce the concept of problem solving in the context of AI and machine learning.

**Context**
This lesson comes early in the presentation, following the introductory lessons on copyright information and acknowledgement of country. It sets the stage for discussing problem solving methodologies and techniques in subsequent lessons.

**Presenter Notes**
This lesson is intentionally left blank to allow the presenter to engage the audience and invite their thoughts on problem solving. The presenter may ask the audience to share examples of problems they have faced in their work or studies related to AI and machine learning. This interaction helps to make the topic more relevant and relatable for the audience.

The lack of bullet points also serves as a visual cue for the presenter to pause and reflect on the importance of problem solving as a fundamental skill in AI and machine learning. It provides an opportunity to emphasise that the ability to break down complex problems, identify key components, and develop systematic approaches is essential for success in this field.

The presenter can use this lesson to highlight that the upcoming lessons will delve into specific problem solving methodologies and techniques that are commonly used in AI and machine learning. This sets the expectation for the audience and helps to create a logical flow for the presentation.
