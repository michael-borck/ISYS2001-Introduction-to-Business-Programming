### Objective
In this exercise, you will load a weather dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and create various visualisations to explore the data. Your tasks include generating a line plot, scatter plot, and bar plot, and then combining these visualisations into a multi-panel figure using subplots.

### Instructions
Follow the steps below and answer the questions to complete the exercise.

### Prerequisites
- Python installed with Pandas, Matplotlib libraries.
- A CSV file. **mock_weather_data_seasonal.csv** containing weather data (e.g., temperature, humidity, precipitation).  Download this form the unit's blackboard site and *upload* to your Google Colab virtual machine.

### Tasks

#### Task 1: Load the Dataset
1. Load the weather dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Use the appropriate function to read the CSV file.
   - Display the first 5 rows of the DataFrame.

   **Questions:**
   - What are the column names in your dataset?
   - How many rows and columns does the dataset have?

```

#### Task 2: Line Plot for Temperature Trends
2. Generate a line plot to visualise temperature trends over time.
   - Choose the appropriate function to plot the data.
   - Set labels for the x-axis and y-axis.
   - Include a title for your plot.

   **Questions:**
   - What trends do you observe in the temperature over time?
   - Are there any noticeable patterns or anomalies?

#### Task 3: Scatter Plot for Temperature vs. Humidity
3. Create a scatter plot to explore the relationship between temperature and humidity.
   - Use the correct function to create a scatter plot.
   - Set labels for the axes and include a title.

   **Questions:**
   - Describe the relationship between temperature and humidity. Is there a correlation?
   - How would you describe the strength and direction of this relationship?

#### Task 4: Bar Plot for Monthly Precipitation
4. Design a bar plot to compare monthly precipitation levels.
   - Group the data by month and calculate the total precipitation for each month.
   - Create the bar plot and set appropriate labels and a title.

   **Questions:**
   - Which month has the highest total precipitation?
   - Are there any months with significantly lower or higher precipitation levels?

```{python}

```

#### Task 5: Multi-Panel Figure with Subplots
5. Combine the line plot, scatter plot, and bar plot into a multi-panel figure using subplots.
   - Arrange the plots in a multi-panel layout.
   - Ensure the plots are clearly labeled for easy comparison.

   **Questions:**
   - How do the different visualisations complement each other?
   - What insights can you draw by comparing these visualisations side by side?
