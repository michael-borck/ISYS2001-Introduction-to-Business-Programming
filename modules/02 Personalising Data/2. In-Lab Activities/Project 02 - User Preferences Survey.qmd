# User Preferences Survey Project

In this project, you will build a simple User Preferences Survey using Python. This project collates many of the exercises from this week’s activities. This is intentional—by combining these exercises, you can reflect on your progress and see how well you’re following the industry best practices we espouse. These practices include:

- **Meaningful Notebook Naming:** Give your notebook a clear, descriptive name (e.g., `user_preferences_survey.ipynb`).
- **Frequent Saves & Version Control:** Save your work often and use descriptive commit messages when uploading to GitHub.
- **Descriptive Variable Names:** Use names like `user_name`, `fav_colour`, etc., to clearly convey their purpose.
- **Code Comments & Documentation:** Use text cells and inline comments to document your thought process.
- **Critical Use of AI:** Ask follow-up questions if anything is unclear, and verify that AI suggestions align with the basics you’ve learnt (i.e., using input(), print(), basic data types, and variables).

> **Tip:** Review these best practices periodically during the project to reinforce good coding habits.

Let's get started!

## Project Overview and Instructions

In this project, you'll create a program that:
1. **Collects User Preferences:**  
   Ask for the user's name, favourite colour, favourite food, and favourite hobby.
2. **Displays a Personalised Summary:**  
   Outputs a clear summary message using the collected data.
3. **Follows Industry Best Practices:**  
   Emphasises meaningful variable names, proper documentation, and good version control.

**Project Steps:**
1. **State the Problem**  
2. **Describe Input and Output**  
3. **Work the Problem by Hand**  
4. **Develop an Algorithm (Pseudocode)**  
5. **Write the Code**  
6. **Reflect on Best Practices & Use AI to Verify**

> **Note:** Use this project as an opportunity to both practise coding and refine your professional development skills.

## Step 1 – State the Problem

Define the goal of your program in your own words. For example:

- **Goal:** Build a program that collects a user's preferences and displays a personalised summary.
- **Data to Gather:** User's name, favourite colour, favourite food, and favourite hobby.

> **AI Usage Tip:**  
> If you're unsure whether your problem statement is clear, ask an AI tool:  
> "Can you restate my description of a User Preferences Survey program using only input(), print(), and variables?"  
> Review the response to ensure it aligns with your current learning.

---

## Step 2 – Describe Input and Output

**Inputs:**  
- `user_name` (string)
- `fav_colour` (string)
- `fav_food` (string)
- `fav_hobby` (string)

**Expected Output:**  
A message like:  
> "Hello, [user_name]! Your favourite colour is [fav_colour], you love [fav_food], and you enjoy [fav_hobby]."

> **Tip:** Mapping your inputs to the expected output helps you visualise the overall flow of your program.

> **AI Usage Tip:**  
> Ask, "What are some creative ways to format this summary message using only the basics?" and verify that the suggestions adhere to input(), print(), and basic variables.

---

## Step 3 – Work the Problem by Hand

Simulate the process with sample inputs. For example, if:
- `user_name` = "Alice"
- `fav_colour` = "blue"
- `fav_food` = "pizza"
- `fav_hobby` = "reading"

Then the expected output is:  
> "Hello, Alice! Your favourite colour is blue, you love pizza, and you enjoy reading."

> **Tip:** Try a few different scenarios on paper to confirm that your plan produces a consistent and clear output.

---

## Step 4 – Develop an Algorithm (Pseudocode)

Outline your approach using pseudocode. For example:

```plain
1. Start the program.
2. Prompt the user for their name and store it.
3. Prompt for favourite colour and store it.
4. Prompt for favourite food and store it.
5. Prompt for favourite hobby and store it.
6. Construct a summary message using these inputs.
7. Print the summary message.
8. End the program.
```

> **Tip:** Your pseudocode need not follow Python syntax—it should simply outline the logical steps of your solution.

> **AI Usage Tip:**  
> Ask an AI tool, "Can you review my pseudocode for a User Preferences Survey program and suggest improvements?" Ensure that any suggestions stay within the basics you have learnt.

---

## Step 5 – Write the Code

Translate your pseudocode into Python code. Below is one example solution:

```{python}
# Collect user input for preferences
user_name = input("What is your name? ")
fav_colour = input("What's your favourite colour? ")
fav_food = input("What's your favourite food? ")
fav_hobby = input("What's your favourite hobby? ")

# Construct the personalised summary message
summary = "Hello, " + user_name + "! Your favourite colour is " + fav_colour + \
          ", you love " + fav_food + ", and you enjoy " + fav_hobby + "."

# Display the summary message
print(summary)
```

> **Industry Best Practices Tip:**  
> - Use descriptive variable names (e.g., `user_name`, `fav_colour`).
> - Include comments to explain code sections.
> - Document your thought process in text cells to support readability and future maintenance.

> **AI Usage Tip:**  
> If you have questions, ask, "Can you review my Python code for a User Preferences Survey and suggest improvements using only input(), print(), and basic variables?" This ensures feedback remains aligned with what you have learnt.

## Reflection on Industry Best Practices

Reflect on these questions:
- How did using descriptive variable names and comments improve your code?
- Did you save your work frequently and use meaningful commit messages on GitHub?
- How did documenting your thought process help you understand your solution better?

> **AI Usage Tip:**  
> Ask an AI tool, "Can you suggest improvements to my project documentation and commit message examples based on industry best practices?" Verify that the suggestions are consistent with the fundamentals you have learnt.

---

## Final Reflection and Next Steps

- **Reflect:**  
  Review your completed project and consider how collating these exercises helped you see your progress. Ask yourself if you’re following the best practices we discussed.
- **Experiment:**  
  Try adding more inputs or adjusting the output format.
- **Share:**  
  Post your project on GitHub with clear commit messages and share it with peers for feedback.
- **Continue Using AI:**  
  Use AI tools to clarify doubts or review your work, but always verify that the suggestions align with what you've learnt (i.e., only using input(), print(), and basic variables).

> **Final Note:**  
> Happy coding, and remember—the practices you develop here are examples from industry that help build clean, maintainable code. They’re not definitive rules, but good habits to emulate as you grow as a software developer.
