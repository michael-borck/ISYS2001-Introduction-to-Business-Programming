# Module 3: Computational Thinking and Algorithm Design

Welcome to Module 3. In this module, we explore how to break down complex problems into manageable steps and design effective algorithms. These skills are key to building our User Preferences project and serve as the foundation for all programming.

::: {.notes}
This module introduces the fundamental concepts of computational thinking and algorithm design, which form the foundation for problem-solving in computer science. We will explore the process of breaking down complex problems into manageable steps, allowing us to develop efficient and effective solutions.

Throughout this module, we will learn how to utilise pseudocode as a planning tool, enabling us to outline our algorithms before diving into the actual coding process. By following a simplified development methodology, we will gain hands-on experience in applying computational thinking principles to real-world scenarios, empowering us to tackle a wide range of programming challenges.

# What is Computational Thinking?

- It is the process of breaking problems into smaller, manageable parts.
- It involves recognising patterns and organising steps logically.
- This mindset helps you devise clear, step-by-step solutions.
- In our User Preferences project, computational thinking guides the way we capture and process user data.

Computational thinking is a problem-solving approach that involves breaking complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts. By recognising patterns and organising steps logically, we can develop clear, step-by-step solutions to these problems. This mindset is particularly useful in the field of computer science, where it helps us to create efficient and effective algorithms.

In our User Preferences project, computational thinking plays a crucial role in guiding the way we capture and process user data. By breaking down the process into smaller, well-defined steps, we can ensure that our solution is both accurate and efficient. This approach allows us to identify potential issues early on and develop a robust solution that meets the needs of our users.

# Breaking Problems into Steps

- Divide a complex problem into simple, individual tasks.
- Tackle each task one at a time.
- For example, a User Preferences programme can be split into:
  - Collecting user input.
  - Processing the data.
  - Displaying a personalised output.

::: {.notes}
Breaking complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks is a key aspect of computational thinking. By dividing a problem into simple, individual steps, you can tackle each task one at a time, making the overall problem less overwhelming. This approach allows you to focus on solving each sub-problem independently, which can lead to a more efficient and effective solution.

To illustrate this concept, consider the example of creating a User Preferences programme. Instead of trying to solve the entire problem at once, you can split it into three main tasks: collecting user input, processing the data, and displaying a personalised output. By addressing each task separately, you can develop a clear plan of action and write code that is more organised and easier to debug. This step-by-step approach forms the foundation of algorithm design and is essential for creating well-structured, efficient programs.

# Pseudocode: Your Planning Tool

- Pseudocode is an informal way to plan your solution without worrying about syntax.
- It lets you outline the logic before writing actual Python code.
- Example for our User Preferences project:
  ```
  Prompt user for name
  Prompt user for favourite colour
  Display personalised greeting using name and colour
  ```
- This step helps you visualise the programme structure clearly.

::: {.notes}
Pseudocode is a valuable tool for planning and outlining the logic of your solution before diving into writing actual Python code. It allows you to focus on the problem-solving process and structure of your programme without getting bogged down in syntax details. By using pseudocode, you can break down the problem into manageable steps and clearly visualise the flow of your programme.

Let's look at an example of how pseudocode can be applied to our User Preferences project. By writing out the high-level steps and logic in plain language, we can map out the key components and flow of the programme. This planning process helps identify any potential issues or areas that need further clarification before starting to code. Once you have a solid pseudocode outline, translating it into Python becomes a more straightforward task.

# Simplified Development Methodology

Our six-step process to design a programme:

1. **Understand the problem:** Restate it in your own words.
2. **Identify the input and output:** Determine what information is needed and what the programme should produce.
3. **Work the problem by hand:** Solve a small example manually.
4. **Write the pseudocode:** Outline the logical steps to solve the problem.
5. **Convert the pseudocode to Python:** Translate your outline into working code.
6. **Test with a variety of data:** Ensure your solution works under different scenarios.

::: {.notes}
The Simplified Development Methodology breaks down the process of solving problems using computational thinking into four key stages: planning, implementation, testing, and evaluation. It provides a structured approach to guide programmers through the development lifecycle, from analysing the problem and designing a solution, to writing code, testing it thoroughly, and refining the solution based on feedback.

By following this methodology, programmers can tackle complex problems in a systematic and organised manner. The planning stage involves understanding the problem, identifying inputs and outputs, and creating a high-level solution using tools like pseudocode or flowcharts. Implementation focuses on translating the plan into working code, while testing ensures the solution performs as expected and handles edge cases. Finally, evaluation allows for reflection on the solution's effectiveness and identification of areas for improvement, fostering continuous learning and growth as a programmer.

# Hands-On Activity

**Task:**  
- Write pseudocode for your User Preferences project using the six-step methodology.
- Begin by restating the problem in your own words.
- Identify the inputs (e.g. name, favourite colour) and the desired output (a personalised greeting).
- Work through an example by hand.
- Write your pseudocode outlining each step.
- Discuss your pseudocode with a peer and refine your approach before converting it to Python in a future session.

::: {.notes}
In this hands-on activity, students will apply the six-step methodology to write pseudocode for their User Preferences project. They should begin by restating the problem in their own words, ensuring they have a clear understanding of the task at hand. Next, they will identify the required inputs, such as the user's name and favourite colour, and the desired output, which is a personalised greeting.

Students will then work through an example manually, step by step, to gain a practical understanding of the process. Following this, they will write their pseudocode, outlining each step in a clear and logical manner. Finally, students will discuss their pseudocode with a peer, providing an opportunity for feedback and refinement before they convert their pseudocode into Python code in a future session.
