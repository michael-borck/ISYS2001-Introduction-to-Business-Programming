Documenting your code is a crucial skill for any programmer. It helps others (and your future self) understand your code. Here's what you need to know to get started:

1. **Why Document Code?**
   - Makes code easier to understand and maintain
   - Helps others (and you) follow your logic
   - Serves as a roadmap for future development

2. **Single-line Comments**
   - Use # for brief explanations
   - Example: # Calculate the average score
   - Ideal for short, in-line clarifications

3. **Multi-line Comments**
   - Use """ or ''' for longer explanations
   - Useful for describing complex functions or classes
   - Example:
     """
     This function calculates the
     average of a list of numbers.
     """

4. **Best Practices**
   - Explain 'why' rather than 'what' the code does
   - Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
   - Use clear, concise language

5. **Code Readability**
   - Well-documented code is easier to debug
   - Comments can outline the structure of your program
   - Use comments to break down complex algorithms

Remember, good documentation is an ongoing process. As you write code, think about how to make it clear and understandable. This is your first step towards professional-level documentation practices.

Pro Tip: Start documenting your code from day one. It's a habit that will serve you well throughout your programming career.
