Writing your first Python program is an exciting step in your coding journey. We'll use Google Colab to create a simple "Hello, World!" program. Here's what you need to know:

1. **Open a New Colab Notebook**
   - Go to colab.research.google.com
   - Click on "New Notebook" or File > New Notebook

2. **Write Your First Code**
   - In the first cell, type the following exactly:
     ```python
     print("Hello, World!")
     ```
   - This command tells Python to display the text "Hello, World!"

3. **Run the Code**
   - Click the play button next to the cell, or
   - Press Shift+Enter on your keyboard

4. **View the Output**
   - Look below the code cell
   - You should see:
     ```
     Hello, World!
     ```

5. **Understand What Happened**
   - `print()` is a Python function that displays text
   - The text inside the parentheses and quotes is the message to display

Congratulations! You've just written and run your first Python program. This simple example demonstrates the basics of writing code and seeing its output. Remember, in Python, accuracy matters - even small errors like missing parentheses can prevent your code from running correctly.

Try modifying the message inside the quotes to print something different. Each time you make a change, run the cell again to see your new output.
