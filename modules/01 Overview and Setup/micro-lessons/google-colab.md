Google Colaboratory, or Colab for short, is a free cloud-based platform that
allows you to write and execute Python code through your browser. Here's the
absolute minimum you need to know:

1. **Accessing Colab**
   - Open your web browser and go to colab.research.google.com
   - Sign in with your Google account

2. **Understanding Colab Notebooks**
   - Colab uses Jupyter notebooks, which combine code, output, and text
   - Notebooks are divided into cells: code cells for Python code and text cells for explanations

3. **No Setup Required**
   - Colab comes pre-installed with popular Python libraries
   - You can start coding immediately without any local installation

4. **Running Code**
   - To run a code cell, click the play button next to it or use Shift+Enter
   - Output appears directly below the code cell

5. **Collaboration Features**
   - Share your notebook by clicking the "Share" button in the top-right corner
   - Others can view or edit your notebook, similar to Google Docs

6. **Free GPU Access**
   - Colab provides free access to GPUs for faster computations
   - To use a GPU, go to Runtime > Change runtime type > Hardware accelerator > GPU

7. **Saving Your Work**
   - Notebooks are automatically saved in your Google Drive
   - You can also save to GitHub or download as .ipynb files

Remember, Colab sessions have time limits and may disconnect after periods of
inactivity. Always save your work frequently. Colab is an excellent tool for
learning Python, data analysis, and even machine learning without the need for
powerful local hardware.
