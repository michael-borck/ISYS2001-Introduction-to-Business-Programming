Technically, there are three different ways to run Python code:

1. In an interactive shell environment on the command line (useful for quick
   calculations and checks, but not much else).
2. In an IPython environment or Jupyter Notebook, which consists of runnable
   “cells” and in-line outputs/visualisations.
3. As a standalone .py script, e.g., `main.py` or `your_script.py` (generally
   executed on the command line with a command like `python your_script.py`).

In industry, the most important of these three approaches are Jupyter notebooks, and running Python scripts.   We’ll focus on these two ways to run Python in “real-world”.

* Running Jupyter Notebooks
* Running Python scripts (later in course)

We can choose to run locally or in the cloud.  Locally means we may have to
install Python, for let's skip that step, let’s look at how to practice them in
the cloud. In the cloud we run Python code on remote servers accessed over the
internet. This also means you can access your code and data from any device.  We
are also using GitHub to store and share our code.  GitHub is great for sharing
code with others, and for keeping track of changes to your code.

I’ve picked these platforms because they are free, beginner-friendly, and widely used in industry.
