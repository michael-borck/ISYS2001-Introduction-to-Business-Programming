The `print()` function is often the first command new Python programmers learn. It's a simple yet powerful tool for displaying information on the screen.

**Basic Syntax:**
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

**Key Points:**
• `print` is a built-in Python function (always lowercase).
• Text to be displayed goes inside parentheses.
• Strings (text) are enclosed in quotation marks.

**Style Tips:**
• No space between `print` and the opening parenthesis.
• Quotation marks hug the text inside.

**Remember:** When the code runs, quotation marks aren't displayed - they're just for Python to recognize strings.

By mastering `print()`, you've taken your first step into the world of Python programming!
