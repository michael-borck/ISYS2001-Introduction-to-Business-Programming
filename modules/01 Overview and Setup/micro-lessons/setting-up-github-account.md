GitHub is a platform for version control and collaboration. Setting up an account is your first step towards using this powerful tool. Here's what you need to know:

1. **Visit GitHub's Website**
   - Open your web browser
   - Go to github.com

2. **Start the Sign-up Process**
   - Click the 'Sign up' button, usually in the top-right corner
   - You'll be taken to the registration page

3. **Choose Your Username**
   - Enter a unique username
   - This will be your GitHub identity, visible to others
   - Choose wisely - it's hard to change later

4. **Provide Your Email**
   - Use a valid email address
   - You'll need this for account verification and notifications

5. **Create a Strong Password**
   - Choose a secure password
   - GitHub will indicate the password strength as you type

6. **Verify Your Account**
   - GitHub will send a verification code to your email
   - Enter this code on GitHub to confirm your account

7. **Complete the Setup**
   - Answer a few questions about your preferences (optional)
   - You may be asked to solve a puzzle to prove you're not a robot

Remember, your GitHub account is often viewed by potential employers and collaborators. Keep it professional and start exploring the world of code repositories and open-source projects!
