Programming is a way of thinking. It is a way of breaking down complex problems
into smaller, more manageable parts. It is a way of designing systems that
perform tasks efficiently and effectively. It is a way of creating solutions to
problems that can be shared, reused, and improved over time.

Programming is a way of thinking that is both creative and analytical. It
requires imagination and logic, intuition and precision. It is a way of
exploring the world, understanding how things work, and making things happen.

Programming is a way of thinking that is both practical and theoretical. It is
a way of solving real-world problems and exploring abstract concepts. It is a
way of building things that work and understanding why they work.

Programming is a way of thinking that is both individual and collaborative. It
is a way of working alone and with others, of creating things on your own and
contributing to projects with many people. It is a way of learning from others
and teaching others, of sharing knowledge and building on the ideas of others.

Programming is a way of thinking that is both challenging and rewarding. It is a
way of facing difficult problems and finding elegant solutions. It is a way of
learning new things and mastering new skills. It is a way of creating things
that are useful, beautiful, and fun.


We're going to start with the ABCs of programming and build from there. As we go, you'll pick up important words that programmers use, like "operator" and "value". Think of it as learning a new language - the language of computers. Knowing these words is super helpful. It's like having the right tools in your toolbox. They'll help you read coding books, chat with other coders, figure out what went wrong when your program hiccups, and even talk to AI helpers about coding. It's all about giving you the know-how to speak 'computer' fluently!
