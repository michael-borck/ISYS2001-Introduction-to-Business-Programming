## Technical Resources and AI Collaboration

### **Recommended AI Prompting Strategies**

#### **Effective Prompt Patterns:**
```
"I'm building a personal finance dashboard in Jupyter with ipwidgets. 
I need [specific functionality] that [user interaction description]. 
My current data structure is [describe your setup]. 
Can you help me create [specific widget type] that [specific behavior]?"
```

#### **Example Effective Prompts:**
```
"Create an ipwidgets interface for expense entry with:
- Dropdown for category selection
- Text input for amount (with validation for positive numbers)
- Text area for description
- Button that adds the expense to a list and updates a total display
- Clear form after successful entry"
```

```
"I have expense data stored as a list of dictionaries. Help me create 
a matplotlib chart within ipwidgets that shows spending by category 
with interactive controls to filter by date range."
```

### **Key ipwidgets Components to Explore**
