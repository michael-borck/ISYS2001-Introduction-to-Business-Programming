# This will keep asking until you enter a valid number
test_number = pyip.inputFloat("Enter any number to test: ")
print(f"You entered: {test_number}")

# This will only accept specific choices
test_choice = pyip.inputChoice(['A', 'B', 'C'], prompt="Choose A, B, or C: ")
print(f"You chose: {test_choice}")
```

**Observation Exercise:** 
- Try entering invalid data (letters when it asks for numbers)
- Notice how pyinputplus handles errors automatically
- Compare this to your manual input validation experience

# Understanding pyinputplus Through AI Exploration

## 🤖 Guided Library Learning

### AI-Assisted Function Discovery

**Learning Prompt:**
```
"I've just installed pyinputplus and want to understand its key functions for my calculator project. 

Please explain these functions with simple examples:
1. pyip.inputFloat() - how is this different from float(input())?
2. pyip.inputChoice() - how does this help with menu selection?
3. pyip.inputInt() vs pyip.inputNum() - when would I use each?

For each function, show me:
- Basic syntax
- What happens when user enters invalid data
- Any useful parameters I should know about"
```

**Try This:** Use the prompt above and take notes on AI's explanations.

### Comparative Analysis

**Manual vs. Library Comparison:**

**Old Way (Manual):**
```python
def get_number(prompt):
    while True:
        try:
            return float(input(prompt))
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input! Please enter a number.")
```

**New Way (pyinputplus):**
```python
import pyinputplus as pyip

def get_number(prompt):
    return pyip.inputFloat(prompt)
```

**Analysis Questions:**
1. How many lines of code did pyinputplus save us?
2. What edge cases does pyinputplus handle that our manual version might miss?
3. What's the trade-off between writing our own validation vs. using a library?

### 🔬 Experimentation Lab

**Hands-On Testing:**
```python
import pyinputplus as pyip

print("=== pyinputplus Experimentation ===")

# Test 1: Basic number input
print("\nTest 1: Try entering letters when it asks for a number")
number = pyip.inputFloat("Enter a number: ")
print(f"Success! You entered: {number}")

# Test 2: Restricted choices
print("\nTest 2: Try entering something other than 1-4")
choice = pyip.inputChoice(['1', '2', '3', '4'], prompt="Enter choice (1-4): ")
print(f"Valid choice: {choice}")

# Test 3: Integer vs Float
print("\nTest 3: Notice the difference")
integer = pyip.inputInt("Enter an integer: ")
any_number = pyip.inputNum("Enter any number: ")
print(f"Integer: {integer}, Any number: {any_number}")
```

**Research Challenge:** 
Ask AI: *"What other pyinputplus functions might be useful for user input validation? Show me 3 more functions with examples."*

# Strategic Calculator Enhancement

## 🎯 Integration Planning with AI

### Step 1: Architecture Analysis

**Before writing code**, let's plan the integration strategically.

**AI Planning Prompt:**
```
"I have a modular calculator with these functions from Activity 1:

```python
def get_operation():
    # displays menu, gets user choice, returns choice

def get_number(prompt):
    # gets a number from user, returns float

def perform_calculation(operation, num1, num2):
    # coordinates the calculation based on operation choice
```

I want to enhance these with pyinputplus. For each function:
1. Which pyinputplus function should I use?
2. What parameters will I need?
3. How can I maintain the same function interfaces?
4. What benefits will this provide over my current implementation?

Help me plan the integration strategy before I start coding."
```

**Strategic Thinking:** How does AI's integration plan compare to your initial thoughts?

### Step 2: Function-by-Function Enhancement

#### 🔄 Enhanced get_operation() Function

**AI-Assisted Development:**
```
"Help me rewrite my get_operation() function to use pyinputplus.inputChoice(). 

Current function:
```python
def get_operation():
    print("Simple Calculator Menu")
    print("1. Add")
    print("2. Subtract")
    print("3. Multiply")
    print("4. Divide")
    choice = input("Enter your choice (1-4): ")
    return choice
```

Requirements:
- Still display the menu
- Use pyip.inputChoice() to ensure valid input
- Keep the same return behavior
- Explain how this improves user experience"
```

**Implementation Challenge:** Write the enhanced function yourself first, then compare with AI's solution.

#### 🔄 Enhanced get_number() Function

**Your Implementation Task:**
1. **First**: Try to enhance `get_number()` yourself using pyinputplus
2. **Then**: Use this AI verification prompt:

```
"I've enhanced my get_number() function with pyinputplus. Please review my implementation:

```python
[paste your code here]
```

Questions:
1. Is this the best pyinputplus function to use?
2. Are there any improvements you'd suggest?
3. How does this handle edge cases better than manual validation?
4. Should I use inputFloat(), inputNum(), or something else?"
```

#### 🔄 Integration Testing

**Complete Integration:**
```python
# Test your enhanced calculator
# Copy your complete modular calculator from Activity 1
# Replace the input functions with pyinputplus versions
# Test thoroughly with invalid inputs

# The calculation functions should remain unchanged!
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

def divide(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return "Error: Cannot divide by zero."
    else:
        return a / b

# Your enhanced input functions go here
# [implement get_operation() and get_number() with pyinputplus]

# Your perform_calculation() function should work unchanged
# [copy from Activity 1]

# Main program should work with minimal changes
```
