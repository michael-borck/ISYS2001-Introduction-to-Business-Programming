# Email Template for Students - Week 5 Prep

**Subject:** Week 5 Lab Prep - Functions & Modules (Quick 15-minute prep!)

Hi everyone,

Here's your quick prep for this week's lab on **Functions & Modules**:

## 🎯 What We're Building This Week
A **modular finance toolkit** using Python functions and libraries - think loan calculators, budget analyzers, and transaction processors that work together.

## 📚 Quick Prep (15 minutes max):

### Option 1: Interactive Quiz (10 min)
Take the **self-assessment quiz**: `interactive_quiz.html`
- 10 questions covering this week's concepts
- Immediate feedback with explanations
- Finance-themed examples

### Option 2: Function Builder (10 min)  
Try the **interactive function builder**: `function_builder.html`
- Drag-and-drop components to build finance functions
- See real code generated instantly
- Four different business scenarios

### Option 3: Skim the Modules (15 min)
Read just the **objectives and examples** from:
- Module 1: Introduction to Functions
- Module 4: Expanding Your Code with Modules

## 🚀 What to Expect in Lab:
- Building functions that **return values** (not just print)
- Using **datetime** and **csv** modules for business applications  
- Creating a **finance toolkit** you can actually use
- Understanding why **modularity** matters for professional development

## ❓ Come Ready to Discuss:
- "When should a function return a value vs print it?"
- "What business problems could benefit from reusable functions?"
- "How do Python modules help avoid 'reinventing the wheel'?"

## 🎯 Why This Matters:
These concepts directly enable the **data visualization dashboard** you'll build in Week 8 and your **final project**. Functions become your business logic toolkit!

**Don't stress if you can't prep** - we'll cover everything in lab. But even 5-6 prepared students make the discussion much more engaging for everyone!

See you in lab,
[Your name]
