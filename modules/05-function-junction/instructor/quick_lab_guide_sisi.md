## Emergency Questions If Students Struggle:

**"What's a function?"**
→ "A business process that takes inputs, does work, gives outputs"

**"Why not just print everything?"**  
→ "Would you rather get a receipt you can use elsewhere, or just a verbal message?"

**"What's the point of modules?"**
→ "Would you rather build a car from scratch or use existing parts?"

## Confidence Builder for You:

**You already know the business context** - that's exactly what these students need! Functions mirror business processes they understand:
- Loan calculations 
- Budget analysis
- Transaction processing

**Your role:** Help them see the professional value, not just the syntax.

---

## If All Else Fails:
Show them the interactive function builder tool - students love drag-and-drop, and it demonstrates the concepts visually even if they haven't read the materials.

**You've got this! The materials are ready and designed for exactly this scenario.**
