# Week 3 Mini-Project: Smart Budget Decisions

## Project Overview

This week, you'll build the **decision-making foundation** for your personal finance tracker. By the end, you'll have a program that makes smart budget decisions - the same logic patterns you learned with grade calculators, but applied to real financial scenarios.

## Learning Objectives

- Apply if/elif/else to financial decision making
- Practice input validation with money amounts
- Build reusable financial logic patterns
- Start your semester-long finance tracker project

## Part 1: Warm-Up - Pattern Recognition (10 minutes)

### From Grades to Money
You've learned to classify test scores into letter grades. Let's apply the **exact same pattern** to classify expenses:

**Grade Classifier** (familiar):
```python
if score >= 90:
    grade = "A"
elif score >= 80:
    grade = "B"
# ... etc
```

**Expense Classifier** (new domain, same logic):
```python
if amount >= 100:
    category = "Major Expense"
elif amount >= 50:
    category = "Moderate Expense"
elif amount >= 10:
    category = "Minor Expense"
else:
    category = "Small Purchase"
```

**Your Task**: Write a complete expense classifier that:

1. Asks user for an expense amount
2. Classifies it using the ranges above
3. Prints a helpful message for each category

## Part 2: Financial Decision Logic (15 minutes)

### Budget Limit Checker
Apply your if/else skills to real budget management:

```{python}
print("=== Budget Limit Checker ===")

# Get user's budget and expense
monthly_budget = float(input("Enter your monthly budget: $"))
expense = float(input("Enter expense amount: $"))

# Decision logic here - you write this part!
# If expense > 50% of budget: "Major purchase - think carefully"
# If expense > 25% of budget: "Significant expense"
# If expense > 10% of budget: "Moderate expense"
# Otherwise: "Minor expense - within budget"
```

### Savings Goal Progress
Use multiple conditions to track savings progress:

```{python}
print("=== Savings Goal Tracker ===")

goal_amount = float(input("Savings goal: $"))
current_savings = float(input("Current savings: $"))

# Your task: Calculate percentage and give encouraging feedback
# 100%+: "Goal achieved! Consider a new goal."
# 75-99%: "Almost there! You're doing great."
# 50-74%: "Halfway there - keep it up!"
# 25-49%: "Good progress, stay consistent"
# Under 25%: "Just getting started - you've got this!"
```

## Part 3: Smart Purchase Advisor (20 minutes)

### The Challenge
Build a program that helps users make smart purchase decisions by considering multiple factors.

### Requirements

Your purchase advisor should:

1. Get purchase amount and user's available money
2. Check if they can afford it (basic affordability)
3. Give different advice based on purchase size
4. Consider their financial situation

### Starter Framework
```{python}
print("=== Smart Purchase Advisor ===")

# Get financial information
available_money = float(input("How much money do you have available? $"))
purchase_price = float(input("How much does the item cost? $"))
monthly_income = float(input("What's your monthly income? $"))

# Calculate affordability percentage
affordability_ratio = purchase_price / available_money

# Your task: Build the decision logic
# Consider:
# - Can they afford it at all?
# - Is it a large percentage of their available money?
# - Is it reasonable compared to their income?
# - What advice should you give?

# Suggestion: Use multiple if/elif conditions to give personalised advice
```

### Sample Decision Logic to Implement

- **Can't afford**: "Save up first - you need $X more"
- **Can afford but expensive**: "You can afford it, but it's Y% of your available money. Consider waiting."
- **Reasonable purchase**: "This seems like a reasonable purchase for your budget"
- **Small purchase**: "This is a minor expense - go for it!"

### Bonus Challenges

If you finish early, add these features:

1. **Emergency fund check**: Warn if purchase would drain emergency savings
2. **Category-based advice**: Different advice for necessities vs luxuries
3. **Payment plan calculator**: Show monthly payment options for large purchases

## Part 4: Building Your Finance Tracker Foundation (15 minutes)

### Start Your Semester Project

Create a new notebook called "Personal_Finance_Tracker" and build the foundation:

```{python}
print("=== Personal Finance Tracker v0.1 ===")
print("Week 3: Smart Budget Decisions")
print()

# User setup
name = input("Enter your name: ")
monthly_income = float(input("Enter your monthly income: $"))

print(f"\nWelcome to your finance tracker, {name}!")
print(f"Monthly income: ${monthly_income:.2f}")

# This week's feature: Expense categorisation
print("\n--- Expense Entry ---")
expense_amount = float(input("Enter an expense: $"))
expense_description = input("What was this expense for? ")

# Apply your decision-making skills here
# Categorise the expense and give feedback
# This becomes the foundation you'll build on each week!
```

### Your Mission

1. Implement the expense categorisation logic
2. Add budget percentage calculations
3. Give helpful feedback to the user
4. Save this notebook - you'll expand it every week!

## Reflection Questions

After completing the mini-project, consider:

1. **Pattern Recognition**: How were the financial decisions similar to grade calculations?
2. **Real-World Application**: Which financial decision logic would be most useful to you personally?
3. **Logic Complexity**: What made some decisions harder to code than others?
4. **Future Features**: What financial decisions would you like your tracker to help with?

---

## Looking Ahead

### Next Week Preview

Week 4 will add **loops** to your finance tracker:

- Track multiple expenses in one session
- Calculate running totals
- Process transaction histories
- Validate input until it's correct

### Final Project Connection

Each week adds new capabilities:

- **Week 3**: Decision making (budget limits, categorisation)
- **Week 4**: Repetition (multiple transactions, validation loops)
- **Week 5**: Data storage (saving/loading financial data)
- **Final**: AI integration (smart financial advice, pattern recognition)

Your mini-projects are building blocks for something you'll actually want to use!

## Success Criteria

**You'll know you're successful when**:
- ✅ Your programs make different decisions based on financial data
- ✅ You can explain why you chose specific budget thresholds
- ✅ Your code handles various expense amounts appropriately
- ✅ You see the connection between programming concepts and real financial decisions
- ✅ You're excited about what you'll add to your tracker next week

**Remember**: This is unassessed practice - focus on learning and experimenting!
