## Thinking Through Multi-Factor Decisions

**Time**: 45 minutes  
**Goal**: Learn to analyse complex problems with multiple conditions and collaborate effectively with AI

---

## The Real-World Challenge

Most interesting decisions involve multiple factors:

- Should Netflix recommend this movie? (Consider: user history, ratings, genre preferences, time of day)
- Should the bank approve this loan? (Consider: credit score, income, employment history, debt ratio)
- Should the game unlock this achievement? (Consider: level, score, time, special actions)

Today you'll learn to think through these multi-factor problems systematically.

## Activity 1: Problem Decomposition (15 minutes)

### The Challenge: Design a Smart Gaming Achievement System

Imagine you're designing achievements for a mobile game. Instead of giving you the rules, you need to **design them yourself**.

**Step 1: Brainstorm Achievement Ideas** (5 minutes)

Think of 2-3 interesting achievements that would require multiple conditions. For example:

- "Speed Demon" - fast completion + high score
- "Perfectionist" - no mistakes + bonus objectives
- "Night Owl" - playing late + consecutive days

**Write your achievement ideas (double-click to edit):**

Achievement 1: 

Requires: 

Achievement 2: 

Requires: 

**Step 2: Define the Logic** (5 minutes)

Pick one achievement and think through the exact conditions:

- What specific numbers/thresholds make sense?
- Should it be AND logic (all conditions) or OR logic (any condition)?
- Are there any special cases or exceptions?

**Write your detailed logic (double-click to edit):**

Achievement: 

Condition 1: 

Condition 2: 

Logic connector (AND/OR): 

Special cases: 

**Step 3: Test Your Design** (5 minutes)

Create some test scenarios:

- Player who clearly should earn it
- Player who clearly shouldn't earn it  
- Borderline case that's tricky to decide

Should earn it: 

Shouldn't earn it:

### AI Collaboration Strategy 1: Design Review

**Good Approach**:

> "I'm designing a gaming achievement with these requirements: [your requirements]. Does this logic make sense? What edge cases am I missing?"

**Less Effective**:

> "Create a gaming achievement system"

**Try it**: Get AI feedback on your achievement design. What suggestions did it make?

## Activity 2: Logic Implementation Challenge (20 minutes)

### Your Mission: Build a College Application Decision System

Universities use complex criteria to make admission decisions. Your job is to design and implement a fair, logical system.

**Step 1: Research and Design** (8 minutes)

Think about what factors matter for college admissions:

- Academic performance (GPA, test scores)
- Extracurricular activities
- Personal essays/interviews
- Special circumstances

**Design your system:**

1. Choose 3-4 factors that matter most
2. Decide how they should combine (AND/OR logic)
3. Define specific thresholds or categories
4. Consider edge cases and tie-breakers

**Write your admission criteria (double-click to edit):**

Factor 1: 

Factor 2: 

Factor 3: 

Decision logic: 

**Step 2: Implement Your Logic** (12 minutes)

Now code your admissions system. You can:

- Start coding yourself and ask AI for help with syntax
- Design the logic first, then ask AI to help implement it
- Code it yourself, then ask AI to review it

**Your implementation:**

```{python}
# College Admissions Decision System
# Your code here




```

**Step 3: Test and Refine**

Test your system with different applicant profiles:

- Strong academic, weak extracurriculars
- Average academics, exceptional leadership
- Good overall, no standout areas

Does your system make decisions you agree with?

---

### AI Collaboration Strategy 2: Implementation Review

**Effective AI Collaboration**:

1. **Logic Clarification**: "I want to check multiple conditions where at least 2 out of 3 must be true. What's the best way to structure this in Python?"

2. **Code Review**: "Here's my admissions logic: [code]. Does this implement what I intended? Are there any logic errors?"

3. **Improvement Suggestions**: "My system works but feels too rigid. How might I make the decision logic more nuanced?"

**Try one of these approaches with your code.**

## Activity 3: Debugging Complex Logic (10 minutes)

### The Mystery: Why Isn't This Working?

A student created this scholarship eligibility system, but it's not working as expected:

```{python}
print("=== Scholarship Eligibility Checker ===")

gpa = float(input("Enter GPA (0.0-4.0): "))
community_hours = int(input("Community service hours: "))
financial_need = input("Have financial need? (yes/no): ").lower()
essay_score = int(input("Essay score (1-10): "))

# Should be eligible if:
# - GPA 3.0+ AND (community hours 50+ OR financial need) AND essay 7+

if gpa >= 3.0 and community_hours >= 50 or financial_need == "yes" and essay_score >= 7:
    print("Eligible for scholarship!")
else:
    print("Not eligible")
```

**Your debugging process:**

**Step 1: Understand the Intent**

What is this code supposed to do? Write the logic in plain English (double-click to edit):

Should be eligible if: 

**Step 2: Trace Through the Logic**

What does this condition actually check?

```python
gpa >= 3.0 and community_hours >= 50 or financial_need == "yes" and essay_score >= 7
```

Think about operator precedence. What gets evaluated first?

**Step 3: Identify the Problem (double-click to edit):**

The problem is: 

The fix is: 

**Step 4: Write the Corrected Version**
```{python}
# Your corrected code here


```

### AI Collaboration Strategy 3: Debugging Partnership

**Instead of**: "Fix this code"

**Try**: "I have code that should check (condition A AND (condition B OR condition C) AND condition D), but it's not working correctly. Can you help me understand what's wrong with the logic?"

**Follow up**: "Can you explain how operator precedence affects this condition?"

## Advanced Challenge: Design Your Own System (Optional)

Choose a real-world decision system that interests you:

- Music recommendation algorithm
- Job application screening
- Restaurant recommendation
- Course enrollment priority
- Dating app matching

**Your challenge:**

1. Define the problem clearly
2. Identify the key factors
3. Design the decision logic
4. Implement in Python
5. Test with realistic scenarios
6. Use AI as a thinking partner, not a code generator

## Reflection Questions

**About Problem-Solving (double-click to edit your answers):**

1. How did breaking complex problems into factors help your thinking?


2. What was harder - defining the logic or implementing it in code?


3. How do you decide when to use AND vs OR vs more complex combinations?


**About AI Collaboration:**

4. When was AI most helpful in your problem-solving process?


5. What's the difference between asking AI to solve a problem vs. asking AI to help you think through a problem?


6. How do you verify that AI's suggestions match your intent?


**About Real-World Applications:**

7. Can you think of a decision system you use daily that probably involves complex logic?


8. What makes a decision system fair and transparent?
