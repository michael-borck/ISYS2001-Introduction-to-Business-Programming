**Question 1: Functions and Control Structures** *(15 marks)*  
Write a Python function that takes a temperature as input and returns a suggestion of what to wear (e.g., "light clothing" for temperatures above 25°C). Use if-else control structures to implement the logic.

- **Concepts Tested:** Function definition, conditional logic.  
- **What to Submit:** Python code and explanation of how functions help make your code reusable.

---

**Question 2: Data Visualisation with Matplotlib** *(15 marks)*  
You are provided with a dataset containing daily weather data (temperature, humidity, and wind speed). Create the following visualisations using Matplotlib:  
- A line plot showing temperature trends over time.  
- A scatter plot showing the relationship between temperature and humidity.  

- **Concepts Tested:** Data visualisation, Matplotlib, basic data analysis.  
- **What to Submit:** Python code, graphs, and a short description of trends you observe.

---

**Question 3: File Handling and Data Analysis with Pandas** *(15 marks)*  
Using Python’s Pandas library, load a CSV file containing weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed). Perform the following tasks:  
1. Display the first five rows of the dataset.  
2. Calculate the average temperature for the dataset.  
3. Create a new column categorising each day as "Hot," "Warm," or "Cold" based on temperature thresholds you define.

- **Concepts Tested:** File handling, data manipulation with Pandas, working with DataFrames.  
- **What to Submit:** Python code and a screenshot of the dataset after adding the new column.

---

**Question 4: Loops and Exception Handling** *(15 marks)*  
Write a Python program that monitors air quality by recording the Air Quality Index (AQI) every hour for 24 hours. If the AQI exceeds 150, the program should raise an exception and stop further recordings.

- **Concepts Tested:** Loops, exception handling, program control flow.  
- **What to Submit:** Python code and a brief reflection on how you handled exception scenarios.

---

**Question 5: Lists and Dictionaries** *(20 marks)*  
You are building a weather tracker that collects data for different cities. Create a Python program that stores weather data (temperature, wind speed, precipitation) for 5 cities in a dictionary. Use a list for the weather readings and store these lists in the dictionary. Then, implement the following:  
- Display the weather data for a specific city.  
- Calculate the average temperature across all cities.

- **Concepts Tested:** Lists, dictionaries, data aggregation, iteration over collections.  
- **What to Submit:** Python code and output showing the results.

---

**Question 6: Problem-Solving with Development Methodology** *(20 marks)*  
Using the first four steps of our six-step development methodology, solve the following problem:

**Problem:**  
Write a program that calculates the wind chill factor based on the current temperature and wind speed. The formula for wind chill is:  

\[
WCI = 13.12 + 0.6215T - 11.37V^{0.16} + 0.3965T \times V^{0.16}
\]

Where:  
- **WCI** = Wind Chill Index (in degrees Celsius)  
- **T** = Temperature (in degrees Celsius)  
- **V** = Wind speed (in km/h)

### Steps:
1. **Understand the Problem**: Rewrite the problem in your own words.
2. **Identify Inputs/Outputs**: Identify the necessary inputs and outputs for the problem.
3. **Work the Problem by Hand**: Perform a manual calculation of the wind chill index for a temperature of 5°C and wind speed of 20 km/h.
4. **Develop the Pseudocode**: Create pseudocode for solving this problem.

- **Concepts Tested:** Problem-solving, inputs/outputs, manual computation, pseudocode development.  
- **What to Submit:** Written answers for steps 1-4, including manual calculations and pseudocode.
