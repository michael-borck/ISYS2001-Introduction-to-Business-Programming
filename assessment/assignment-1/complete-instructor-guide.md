**Purpose:**  

These guidance notes provide instructions for marking the Reflective Journal
Assessment using the simplified rubric. Please ensure you only assess
submissions from students specific tutorial groups assigned to you.

**General Instructions:**

- Each week’s journal is worth 1 mark:  
- Reflective writing is available in Turnitin, while notebooks are in the submitted journals.
- Turnitin is mainly for plagarism and high AI.
- For the notebooks, sample three entries (one every two weeks) to assess
  completion. If a student has not completed the bulk of the notebook tasks,
  give **0 marks** for that element.
- Be firm on notebook completion: incomplete or poorly attempted notebooks
  should receive **0 marks** for the coding element.
- Each week’s journal is worth **1 mark** in total, based on both the reflective
  writing and the coding notebooks.
- Use the **Levels of Achievement** rubric to assess the overall quality of the
  journal entry, which includes both reflective writing and the notebooks.
  - Zero: Incomplete or inaccurate work.
  - 0.5: Basic or limited work with issues such as poor formatting, indentation, or lack of comments in the code.
  - 1: Thoughtful work with functional code but some minor issues, and good reflection.
  
### **Notebook Sampling**:

- Sample three student notebooks (one every two weeks) to evaluate both the
  quality and completeness of their coding work.
- Use the rubric to assess the overall quality, combining both the reflective
  writing and the coding elements into one unified evaluation.

---

This simplified approach allows you to evaluate the journal entry holistically
without splitting marks between reflection and code, while still maintaining a
clear grading structure based on the quality of both components.

---

### **Week 1** (1 mark)
- **Reflective Writing**  
  - Check that students reflect on their learning experience and engagement with
    the material in the journal body. Award 0.5 marks for a reasonable level of
    reflection.
- **Notebooks**  
  - Verify that students have:
    - Completed `hello_world.ipynb`
    - Provided evidence for the **Code Magnets** exercise
    - Completed the **Sharpen My Pencil** task  
  - Award 0.5 marks only if the bulk of these tasks are complete.

---

### **Week 2** (1 mark)
- **Reflective Writing**  
  - As in Week 1, evaluate whether students provide thoughtful reflections on their learning progress.
- **Notebooks**  
  - Check for completion of:
    - An updated `sundae_winner.ipynb`
    - Completion of `a_taste_of_python.ipynb`  
  - Award 0.5 marks for substantial completion of the notebooks.

---

### **Week 3** (1 mark)
- **Reflective Writing**  
  - Continue assessing reflective quality on learning experiences.
- **Notebooks**  
  - Confirm completion of:
    - **Weather Adventures Pseudocode Worksheet**
    - **Weather Adventures Notebook**  
  - Full 0.5 marks if both are completed satisfactorily.

---

### **Week 4** (1 mark)
- **Reflective Writing**  
  - As with previous weeks, evaluate the reflective writing for depth of thought.
- **Notebooks**  
  - Check for:
    - Completion of the **Data Structures Worksheet**
    - The **Business Buzzword Notebook**  
  - Award 0.5 marks if both tasks are completed adequately.

---

### **Week 5** (1 mark)
- **Reflective Writing**  
  - Evaluate reflections on Week 5's content and engagement.
- **Notebooks**  
  - Ensure the **Functions Worksheet** is completed.  
  - Full marks if the worksheet is substantially finished.

---

### **Week 6** (1 mark)
- **Reflective Writing**  
  - Continue to assess the depth and thoughtfulness of student reflections.
- **Notebooks**  
  - Check for completion of the **Input Validation** task.  
  - Award full marks for substantial completion.

**Note to Tutors:**

Roughly 0.5 for journal entry, 0.5 for the code/notebooks.  Sample student
notebooks once every two weeks (3 in total). If a student has completed most of
the tasks in the notebook, award 0.5 marks. If the bulk is not completed, award
0 marks for the coding element.
