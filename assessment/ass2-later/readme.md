# Weather Advisor Project

## Overview

This repository contains the starter template for the Weather Advisor project. You'll build a Python application that combines weather data access with conversational AI capabilities, demonstrating your programming skills and ability to work effectively with AI tools.

## Getting Started

1. **Setup Your Repository**
   - You're already here if you've used the template! If not, click "Use this template" to create your own repository.
   - Clone your repository to your local machine or connect directly to Google Colab.

2. **Open the Notebook**
   - The main file is `weather_advisor.ipynb` - open this in Google Colab.
   - Use Colab's GitHub integration to save your work directly to your repository.

3. **Review the Requirements**
   - Read the full assignment specification in the `ASSIGNMENT.md` file.
   - Check the `CHECKLIST.md` file for a list of requirements to complete.

## Repository Structure

- `weather_advisor.ipynb`: Main Colab notebook for your project
- `PROMPTING.md`: Template for documenting your AI interactions
- `CHECKLIST.md`: Requirements checklist to track your progress
- `README.md`: This file
- `conversation1.txt`, etc.: Where you'll save your AI conversation logs

## Suggested Timeline

This project has a 5-week timeline. Here's a suggested breakdown of tasks:

### Week 1: Setup and Basic Functionality
- Set up repository and familiarize yourself with the template
- Implement basic weather data retrieval functions
- Test API connectivity and basic data processing

### Week 2: Visualization and UI Framework
- Create initial data visualization functions
- Design and implement the menu system
- Develop basic user interface components

### Week 3: Natural Language Interface
- Implement question parsing functionality
- Create response generation system
- Connect natural language processing to weather data

### Week 4: Integration and Feature Completion
- Integrate all components (data, visualization, NLP)
- Refine user experience and interface
- Implement additional features and error handling

### Week 5: Testing and Documentation
- Perform comprehensive testing with various inputs
- Complete AI conversation documentation
- Finalize your submission materials
- Review against the checklist and assignment requirements

## Requirements Summary

Your Weather Advisor application must include:

1. **Weather Data Component**
   - Retrieve weather data for user-specified locations
   - Display current conditions and forecasts
   - Include at least 2 different data visualizations

2. **Natural Language Interface**
   - Allow users to ask weather-related questions in plain English
   - Parse these questions to determine the weather information needed
   - Provide natural-language responses

3. **User Experience**
   - Implement an intuitive menu system using pyinputplus
   - Include clear instructions and error handling
   - Provide a clean, organized display of information

Additionally, you must document your intentional prompting process with AI assistants.

## Documentation Requirements

Remember to document your AI interactions in the following ways:

1. **PROMPTING.md file**: Document your intentional prompting process
2. **Conversation logs**: Save your AI conversations as text files
3. **Before/After examples**: Show how you improved AI-generated code
