This file documents my process of working with AI tools to develop the Weather Advisor application. Below, I'll demonstrate how I used intentional prompting techniques to guide AI assistance throughout the project.

## Six-Step Methodology Example

For the [component name], I applied the six-step programming methodology with AI assistance:

### 1. Restate the Problem
I restated the problem in my own words:
```
[Your problem restatement here]
```

### 2. Identify Input/Output Requirements
I identified the following requirements:
- Inputs: 
  - [List inputs]
- Outputs: 
  - [List outputs]

### 3. Work Through Example by Hand
I worked through a simplified example:
```
[Your example walkthrough]
```

### 4. Write Pseudocode
I developed this pseudocode:
```
[Your pseudocode]
```

### 5. Convert to Python
I converted the pseudocode to Python with AI assistance (see Conversation X).

### 6. Test with Data
I tested with various inputs including:
- [Test case 1]
- [Test case 2]
- [Edge case: empty data]

## Weather Data Component

### Initial Prompt
```
[Your initial prompt to the AI]
```

### AI Response
```
[Summary or excerpt of AI's response]
```

### My Evaluation
I evaluated the AI's response and identified these issues:
- [Issue 1]
- [Issue 2]
- [Strength 1]

### Refined Prompt
```
[Your follow-up prompt]
```

### Final Implementation
After several iterations, here's the final implementation with my modifications:

```python
# Your final code here
```

## Before/After Examples

### Example 1: [Component Name]

#### Before: Initial AI-Generated Code
```python
# Initial code generated by AI
```

#### My Prompting Strategy
```
I asked the AI to improve the code by [your strategy]. Specifically, I pointed out [issues].
```

#### After: Improved Implementation
```python
# Improved code after my directed prompting
```

#### Why This Approach Worked
This approach was effective because:
- [Reason 1]
- [Reason 2]
