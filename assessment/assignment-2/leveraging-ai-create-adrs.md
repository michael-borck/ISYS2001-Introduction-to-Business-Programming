# Optional: Formalising AI Interactions with Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

> **Please Note:** The following information is **entirely optional** and is not a requirement for the "WeatherWise: Intelligent Weather Analysis & Advisory System" assignment. It is offered as an additional resource, primarily for those students who may be interested in more advanced software development practices or for your own reference in future projects should you wish to take your programming journey further.
>
> Consider this a supplementary technique for formalising your thought processes and the key decisions derived from your interactions with AI tools, which can be valuable in more complex projects or team environments.

In software development, including projects like your "WeatherWise" assignment, you'll often make design and implementation choices. AI tools (like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Claude, etc.) can be incredibly helpful for exploring options, understanding concepts, and generating initial code.

While the "WeatherWise" assignment requires you to document your AI interactions through conversation logs and before/after examples, another structured approach used in the industry is Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

## **What are Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)?**

An ADR is a short document that captures a significant design or architectural decision made during a project. Each ADR typically describes:
* The **context** of the decision (the problem you were trying to solve).
* The **decision** itself.
* The **alternatives considered** (perhaps with AI's help).
* The **rationale** (why you chose that option) and the consequences.

Think of ADRs as a way to create a clear history of *why* certain choices were made, which can be invaluable for future understanding, especially as projects evolve or if you revisit them later.

## **How This Relates to Your AI Conversations:**

Your AI conversations for the "WeatherWise" assignment are a form of discovery and decision-making documentation. If you were to use ADRs in a future project, the process might look like this:

1.  **Exploration with AI:** You'd use AI to explore solutions to a problem (e.g., "What are different ways to structure my Python application for fetching and displaying weather data?").
2.  **Critical Evaluation & Decision:** You'd analyse AI's suggestions and make a deliberate choice.
3.  **Documenting with an ADR:** You'd then create a brief ADR to formalise that decision, outlining the context, your choice, other options AI might have presented, and why you picked your final approach. This would complement, or in some professional settings, even structure the insights gained from your AI interactions.

## **Why Consider This for the Future?**

* **Deeper Understanding:** Explaining *why* a choice was made (a core part of an ADR) solidifies your understanding.
* **Structured Record:** Provides a more formal and standardised way to record key decisions beyond conversational logs.
* **Professional Practice:** ADRs are a recognised practice in many software engineering teams.

For the "WeatherWise" assignment, the specified AI conversation documentation (text files, before/after examples, demonstrating intentional prompting) is what you need to focus on. However, being aware of ADRs can provide you with an additional tool for your developer toolkit as you progress in your studies or career, offering a structured way to document how AI (and other research) informs your critical project decisions.

You would typically store ADRs in a dedicated folder (e.g., `docs/adr`) within your project repository.

Again, this is **not a requirement for your current assignment** but an insight into further practices you might find useful later on. Your primary focus should remain on fulfilling the AI documentation requirements as detailed in the "WeatherWise: Intelligent Weather Analysis & Advisory System" assignment specification.
