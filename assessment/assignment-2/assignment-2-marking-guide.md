### **Introduction**

Weather data provides us with invaluable insights into our environment, impacting everything from daily activities to global business decisions. In this assignment, "Weather Wizards: Crafting Interactive Dashboards," they will create a Python-based dashboard that visualises real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. By working through data collection, processing, and visualisation tasks, they will not only improve there technical skills but also gain experience in using AI tools to support there coding. they will document there development process, demonstrating a structured approach to problem-solving with effective code organisation, error handling, and iterative improvements captured through version control. This assignment will challenge they to balance functionality with ethical considerations, as they incorporate tools like GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT and manage there API key responsibly. 

In addition to the final product, a clear development process and appropriate referencing of any AI assistance are essential for success. This project is an opportunity to demonstrate there ability to craft professional, real-world solutions in a structured, ethical, and transparent manner.

### **Feedback Section**

The following feedback examples are designed to provide students with a clear understanding of how their work will be assessed across different performance levels. Emphasising both the process and the final product, this feedback highlights areas of strength and opportunities for improvement, focusing on critical aspects like code quality, documentation, ethical use of AI, and effective version control practices. These examples illustrate the expectations for a well-rounded submission, guiding students toward developing both technical and professional skills in creating interactive, data-driven solutions.

#### **Poor Submission**

- **Feedback:** "there submission met some basic requirements but missed several key aspects. The dashboard could display weather data, but it lacked error handling for API responses, making it unreliable. The code was not well organised, and functions were not modularised, making it hard to follow. Documentation and comments were minimal, and there was no mention of AI tools despite signs of AI-generated code structure. The GitHub commit history was sparse, and commit messages were not descriptive, missing a clear record of there development process. For improvement, focus on structuring there code with functions, adding error handling, and providing thorough documentation, including any AI assistance."

#### **Average Submission**

- **Feedback:** "there submission met most of the requirements and demonstrated a solid understanding of dashboard development. The dashboard functioned well, showing accurate weather data with basic visualisations. Some error handling was included but could be expanded for more robustness. Code organisation was generally clear, but certain functions could be further modularised. Documentation was good, with most functions commented, though references to AI tool usage were minimal and could have been more explicit. GitHub commits were regular, showing a structured process, though some messages were too general. To excel, focus on adding detailed AI references, enhancing error handling, and using clearer, descriptive commit messages to reflect each phase of development."

#### **Excellent Submission**

- **Feedback:** "Outstanding work! there submission demonstrated a well-rounded, professional approach to creating a weather dashboard. The dashboard is not only functional and visually engaging but also includes multiple data parameters and interactive elements, showing advanced handling of API data. Error handling was thorough, making the dashboard resilient to invalid inputs. Code was highly organised into modular functions with clear docstrings and comments, making it easy to understand. they transparently documented there use of AI tools, with insightful reflections on their role in there process. there GitHub commit history was excellent, showing iterative progress with detailed, meaningful commit messages. This submission reflects a strong command of technical skills and ethical standards, setting a high benchmark."
