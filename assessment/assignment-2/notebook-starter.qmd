# Introduction

In this project, we develop a....

# Setup

*Import necessary libraries and set up any configurations.*

```{python}
# Import necessary libraries
import requests
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# If you plan to use seaborn for enhanced visuals, uncomment the following lines:
# import seaborn as sns
# sns.set(style="darkgrid")

# Configure matplotlib for inline display in the notebook
%matplotlib inline

```

# API Key Management

*Securely manage your API key without exposing it in the notebook.*

```{python}
def get_api_key():
    """
    Reads the API key from a file or prompts the user to input it.

    Returns:
    - api_key (str): The API key as a string.
    """
    # TODO: Implement the secure retrieval of the API key.

    # Consider the following questions to guide your implementation:

    # - How can you check if a file containing the API key exists?
    #   - Which Python module and functions can help you determine if a file exists?
    # - If the file exists, how can you read the API key from it?
    #   - What methods are available for reading from a file?
    # - If the file does not exist, how can you prompt the user to input their API key?
    #   - Which function allows you to receive input from the user?
    # - How can you ensure that the API key is kept secure and not exposed in your code or repository?
    #   - Where should the API key file be stored, and should it be included in version control?
    # - Is there a way to handle exceptions that might occur during file operations?
    #   - How can you use try-except blocks to manage potential errors?

    # You may consult Python's file handling documentation or ask your GenAI assistant for guidance.

    pass

# Get the API key
api_key = get_api_key()
```

# Data Collection and API Usage

*Function to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.*

```{python}
def fetch_weather_data(city, api_key):
    """
    Fetches weather data for the specified city from the OpenWeatherMap API.

    Parameters:
    - city (str): The name of the city for which to fetch weather data.
    - api_key (str): Your OpenWeatherMap API key.

    Returns:
    - data (dict): A dictionary containing the weather data, or None if an error occurs.
    """
    # TODO: Implement the API call to OpenWeatherMap

    # Consider:
    # - What is the base URL for the current weather data API?
    # - What parameters need to be included in your request?
    # - How can you use the 'requests' library to send an HTTP GET request?
    # - How will you handle possible errors, such as network issues or invalid responses?

    # Resources:
    # - OpenWeatherMap API Documentation: https://openweathermap.org/current

```

# Data Processing

*Function to process and extract necessary weather parameters.*

```{python}
# Function to process weather data
def process_weather_data(data):
    """
    Processes raw weather data and extracts required parameters.

    Parameters:
    - data (dict): The raw weather data obtained from the API.

    Returns:
    - weather_info (dict): A dictionary containing extracted weather parameters.
    """
    # TODO: Extract necessary weather parameters from the data

    # Questions to consider:
    # - Which keys in the 'data' dictionary contain the temperature and humidity?
    # - How can you handle cases where certain data might be missing or malformed?
    # - What structure will your 'weather_info' dictionary have?

    # Tip:
    # - Use the 'get' method for dictionaries to safely access keys that might not exist.

    # You can refer to sample API responses in the OpenWeatherMap documentation.
    pass
```



# Visualisation Functions

*Functions to create visualisations.*

```{python}
# Function to plot temperature
def plot_temperature(weather_info):
    """
    Plots the temperature for the selected city.

    Parameters:
    - weather_info (dict): A dictionary containing the weather information.

    Returns:
    - None
    """
    # TODO: Implement the plotting of temperature

    # Reflect on:
    # - What is an appropriate type of plot for displaying the temperature of a single city?
    # - How can you set up your data and labels for this plot?
    # - What customisations will enhance the readability and presentation of your plot?

    # Utilise resources like the matplotlib documentation or your GenAI assistant to help you.
    pass



def plot_humidity(weather_info):
    """
    Plots the humidity for the selected city.

    Parameters:
    - weather_info (dict): A dictionary containing the weather information.

    Returns:
    - None
    """
    # TODO: Implement the plotting of humidity

    # Consider the following questions to guide your implementation:

    # - How can you create a figure with an appropriate size using matplotlib?
    # - What type of plot would effectively display the humidity for a single city?
    # - How will you extract the necessary data from 'weather_info' for your x and y values?
    # - How can you customise your plot to make it informative and visually appealing?
    # - How do you display the plot within the notebook?

    # You may consult the matplotlib documentation or use your GenAI assistant for guidance.

```

# Interactive Dashboard Development

*Create interactive elements using ipywidgets.*

```{python}
# List of cities to choose from
cities = ['New York', 'London', 'Tokyo', 'Sydney', 'Mumbai']

# Dropdown widget for city selection

# Display Dropdown
```

# Dashboard Interaction

*Function to update and display data based on user interaction.*

    Parameters:
    - change: The change event triggered by the widget.

    Returns:
    - None
    """
    # TODO: Update the dashboard based on the selected city

    # Consider the following steps:

    Parameters:
    - weather_info (dict): A dictionary containing the weather information.

    Returns:
    - None
    """
    # TODO: Print out the weather information in a readable format

    # Consider the following questions to guide your implementation:

    # - What key pieces of weather information should be displayed to the user?
    #   - For example: city name, weather description, temperature, humidity.
    # - How can you access these pieces of information from the 'weather_info' dictionary?
    #   - What keys correspond to the data you need?
    # - How can you format the output to make it clear and user-friendly?
    #   - Can you use f-strings or the 'format' method for string formatting?
    # - Are there any transformations or formatting needed for the data?
    #   - Should the weather description be capitalised?
    #   - Do you need to add units to the temperature and humidity (e.g., °C, %)?
    # - How can you handle cases where certain data might be missing from 'weather_info'?
    #   - Should you include error checking or default values?

    # You may find it helpful to review Python string formatting and error handling.
    pass
```

*Attach the update function to the dropdown widget.*

```{python}
# Attach the update function to the dropdown


# Initial call to display data for the default city

```

# Methods

*Detailed explanation of data collection and processing steps.*


## Data Collection

We collected weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. The `fetch_weather_data` function sends a GET request to the API with the selected city and processes the JSON response.

## Data Processing

The `process_weather_data` function extracts key parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description from the API response. These parameters are then used for visualisation and display.

# Results

*Present visualisations and interpret them.*

*The visualisations are displayed above in the dashboard interaction section.*


# Discussion

*Reflect on the use of Version control, AI tools, challenges faced, and solutions implemented.*
