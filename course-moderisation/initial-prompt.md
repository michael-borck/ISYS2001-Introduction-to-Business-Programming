Please read the file instructional-design-workflow.md and all materials in the folder 1_legacy_materials/06-dictionaries. Review these to determine whether the content is suitable as-is or needs updating.

The final assignment is based on developing a smart finance app. In the mini-projects, students are gradually building their understanding of programming concepts in the finance domain (that is the mini project help prepare for the upcoming assignment)  Note the moni project should only take about 1-2 hours to complete. I prefer that lecture examples, worksheets, and mini-projects use different themes/domains. This requires students to recognize and apply concepts across contexts rather than relying on repetition. In particular:

* Worksheets should not directly use the finance theme of the mini-project.
* Lecture examples should also avoid using the exact same theme as worksheets or projects.

For this week, I also need a new mini-project notebook. Last week’s mini-project can be found in:
1_legacy_materials/06-dictionaries/week5_finance_modularity_miniproject.qmd.
It would be good to extend that project: for example, if students previously worked with parallel lists, this week we could introduce dictionaries as a more structured approach.  Or could be something totaly different, related to finance that may be helpful for a smart finance app.

Follow the Instructional Design Workflow, starting with Step 1: Review the materials and ask clarifying questions to create the LRD for Week 6.

Context:

Course: ISYS2001 Introduction to Business Programming

Week: 6 – Organising Your Thoughts (with Dictionaries)

Format: Flipped classroom (flipped lecture + interactive lab)

Delivery: Python notebooks and HTML-based activities where appropriate

Students: First-year Information Systems majors

Time Allocation: 1-hour flipped lecture, 2-hour lab

Here is what we know, need example to stick within this (no expectation handling or OOP etc. For validiation in input and simple menus we use the python package pyinputplus)

Week 1 - feeling the vibe
Week 2 - data bnd variables
Week 3 - making decisions
Week 4 - doing it again (loops and lists)
Week 5 - functions and modularity

Please begin with Step 1 of the workflow.
