## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Content Creation (P0 Tasks)
Focus on essential materials needed for class delivery:
1. Pre-class modules (immediate need for flipped classroom)
2. Interactive HTML exercise (main in-class activity)  
3. Mini-project dual pathways (primary learning deliverable)

### Phase 2: Workshop and Assessment (P1-P2 Tasks)
Develop supporting materials:
4. Library management workshop (theme variety)
5. Instructor resources (delivery support)
6. Self-assessment tools (reinforcement)

### Quality Assurance Checkpoints
- [ ] All materials use Australian-British spelling
- [ ] Theme variety maintained across components
- [ ] Student choice clearly supported in mini-project
- [ ] Complexity appropriate for first-year students
- [ ] QMD to .ipynb conversion tested
- [ ] Accessibility standards met

### Integration Requirements
- [ ] Materials ready for Google Colab deployment
- [ ] Pre-class modules released 1 week before lab
- [ ] All assessments formative only
- [ ] pyinputplus usage maintained (no exception handling)
- [ ] Progressive complexity building toward Pandas
