# Part 1: Mindset Shift Demo (20 minutes)

## 🔄 The Workflow Revolution

Let's demonstrate the difference between old-school programming and AI collaboration.

### Old Way Demo: Manual Coding

Imagine trying to analyze spending data the traditional way:

```python
# Old approach - lots of manual work and potential errors
import pandas as pd

# Load data with potential issues
df = pd.read_csv('transactions.csv')

# Oh no! Amounts have dollar signs - need to clean manually
df['Amount'] = df['Amount'].str.replace('$', '')
df['Amount'] = pd.to_numeric(df['Amount'])

# Calculate totals by category - hoping syntax is right
category_totals = {}
for index, row in df.iterrows():
    if row['Category'] in category_totals:
        category_totals[row['Category']] += row['Amount']
    else:
        category_totals[row['Category']] = row['Amount']

# Sort manually
sorted_categories = sorted(category_totals.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
print(sorted_categories)
```

**Problems with this approach:**
- Lots of syntax to remember
- Easy to make mistakes
- Repetitive patterns
- Hard to modify or extend
- Time-consuming debugging

### New Way Demo: AI Collaboration

Now let's see the AI-assisted approach:

::: {.callout-note}
## AI Collaboration Example

**Your Prompt to AI:**
*"I have a CSV file with columns Date, Amount, Category, Description. The Amount column has dollar signs that need cleaning. I want to calculate total spending by category and show results sorted from highest to lowest. Please write pandas code with comments explaining each step."*

**AI Response:**
:::

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the transaction data
df = pd.read_csv('transactions.csv')

# Clean the Amount column by removing dollar signs and converting to numeric
df['Amount'] = pd.to_numeric(df['Amount'].str.replace('$', ''), errors='coerce')

# Remove any rows where Amount couldn't be converted (invalid data)
df = df.dropna(subset=['Amount'])

# Calculate total spending by category
category_spending = df.groupby('Category')['Amount'].sum()

# Sort from highest to lowest spending
category_spending = category_spending.sort_values(ascending=False)

# Display results in a business-friendly format
print("💰 Spending Summary by Category")
print("=" * 35)
for category, amount in category_spending.items():
    print(f"{category:<15}: ${amount:>8.2f}")

print(f"\n📊 Total Spending: ${category_spending.sum():.2f}")
```

**Benefits of AI collaboration:**
- ✅ Clear, commented code
- ✅ Handles data cleaning automatically
- ✅ Business-friendly output formatting
- ✅ Easy to understand and modify
- ✅ Professional code structure

## 🤔 Your Assignment Isn't Scary!

**Here's the secret**: Your Smart Finance Assistant assignment is just an extension of what we're doing today. It uses:

- **CSV data processing** (what we're learning now)
- **AI assistance** (what we're practicing now)
- **Gradio interface** (simple web UI - we'll cover this later)
- **Business insights** (your analysis skills)

**By starting today, you're already 10% done with your final project!**

# Part 2: Guided Practice with Sample Data (30 minutes)

Let's practice AI collaboration with real business data before moving to your assignment.

## 📁 Loading Sample Data

First, let's load our sample transaction data:

```{python}
import pandas as pd

# Load the sample transactions
df = pd.read_csv('../data/transactions.csv')

# Display the first few rows to understand our data
print("📋 Sample Transaction Data:")
print("=" * 40)
print(df.head())

print(f"\n📊 Dataset Info:")
print(f"Total transactions: {len(df)}")
print(f"Date range: {df['Date'].min()} to {df['Date'].max()}")
print(f"Categories: {df['Category'].unique()}")
```

## 🤖 AI Collaboration Exercise 1: Basic Analysis

**Your Turn**: Practice prompting AI for basic data analysis.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Practice Prompt Template

Try asking AI:
*"Using this transaction DataFrame, I want to understand my spending patterns. Please create code that shows:
1. Total spending by category
2. Average transaction amount by category  
3. Number of transactions per category
Format the output to be easy to read for a business presentation."*
:::

**Expected AI Response** (try this yourself first!):

```{python}
# AI-generated solution for spending analysis

# Calculate comprehensive spending summary
spending_analysis = df.groupby('Category')['Amount'].agg({
    'Total_Spent': lambda x: pd.to_numeric(x.str.replace('$', ''), errors='coerce').sum(),
    'Avg_Amount': lambda x: pd.to_numeric(x.str.replace('$', ''), errors='coerce').mean(),
    'Transaction_Count': 'count'
}).round(2)

# Sort by total spending
spending_analysis = spending_analysis.sort_values('Total_Spent', ascending=False)

print("💼 Business Spending Analysis")
print("=" * 50)
print(f"{'Category':<15} {'Total':<10} {'Average':<10} {'Count':<8}")
print("-" * 50)

for category, row in spending_analysis.iterrows():
    total = row['Total_Spent']
    avg = row['Avg_Amount'] 
    count = row['Transaction_Count']
    print(f"{category:<15} ${total:<9.2f} ${avg:<9.2f} {count:<8.0f}")

print(f"\nGrand Total: ${spending_analysis['Total_Spent'].sum():.2f}")
```

## 🔍 Practice Your Critique Skills

Look at the AI-generated code above. Apply your critique toolkit:

1. **Do you understand each line?**
2. **Is it handling the dollar signs correctly?**
3. **Is the output business-appropriate?**
4. **What would you ask AI to improve?**

::: {.callout-warning}
## Critique Practice

The code above has an issue with handling the dollar signs in a grouped operation. How would you prompt AI to fix this?

**Sample critique prompt:**
*"The code is trying to clean dollar signs inside the groupby operation, which is inefficient. Can you first clean the Amount column once, then do the groupby analysis? Also add error handling for invalid amounts."*
:::

## 🤖 AI Collaboration Exercise 2: Business Insights

**Challenge**: Ask AI to help you identify spending patterns that would be useful for financial planning.

**Sample prompt to try:**
*"Based on this spending data, help me identify potential areas where I could reduce expenses. Look for categories with high spending or frequent transactions that might represent opportunities for savings."*

```{python}
# Your AI collaboration code goes here
# Try the prompt above and see what AI suggests!

```
