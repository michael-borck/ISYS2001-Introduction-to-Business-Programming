## 🎯 Why This Matters

AI can generate code quickly, but it doesn’t always give the *right* code. As a programmer, **your job is to review, critique, and decide**:

* Does this solution make sense?
* Is it too complex for the problem?
* Do I understand what it does?

## 🛠️ Heuristics for Critiquing AI Code

Use these rules of thumb to guide your decision-making:

1. **Too Complex?**

   * *“This looks harder than it should be. Can you simplify it?”*

2. **Don’t Understand?**

   * *“Explain what each line does.”*
   * *“Rewrite with comments.”*

3. **Strange Results?**

   * *“Test with this simple input: …”*
   * *“Why does this give the wrong output?”*

4. **Taking Too Long to Fix?**

   * *“Start over. Give me the simplest working solution first.”*

5. **Looks Repetitive?**

   * *“Turn this into a function.”*
   * *“Can you make this more concise?”*

## 💬 Sample Critique Prompts

Try asking AI these kinds of questions:

* *“What assumptions are you making about my data?”*
* *“Show me a version that only uses 10 lines of code.”*
* *“Why did you use this library? Is there a simpler way?”*
* *“Split this into smaller functions so I can test them individually.”*
* *“Give me a minimal version first, then add extra features.”*

## 📓 Reflection Reminder

In your **Developer’s Diary**, document how you responded:

* Did you accept, adapt, or reject the suggestion?
* Why? What did you learn?

> Example entry: *“AI suggested a Pandas one-liner. I asked for a simpler version with comments. The new version was easier to follow, so I used it. I learned how to coerce non-numeric values safely.”*

✅ Use this toolkit every week as you build your **Smart Finance Assistant**. The goal is not just working code, but learning how to **direct AI like a junior developer**.
