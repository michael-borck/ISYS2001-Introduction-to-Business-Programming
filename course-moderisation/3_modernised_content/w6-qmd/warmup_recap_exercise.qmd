## 🎯 Session Goals

Welcome to Week 6! Today we'll apply dictionary concepts through hands-on practice. This warm-up helps us:
- Activate your knowledge from the pre-class modules
- Identify any gaps in dictionary understanding
- Prepare for today's library management workshop
- Build confidence with dictionary operations

## 📚 Quick Knowledge Check

Before we start building systems, let's test our dictionary fundamentals with some prediction exercises.

### Check 1: Basic Dictionary Operations

Look at this code and predict what each line will output **before running it**:

```{python}
# Student record for our examples
student = {
    'name': 'Alice Johnson',
    'age': 19,
    'major': 'Business Information Systems',
    'gpa': 3.7,
    'courses': ['ISYS2001', 'MATH1001', 'ECON1001']
}

print("=== Prediction Exercise ===")
print("What will each line print? Discuss with your partner first!")
```

```{python}
# Line 1: Direct access
print("1.", student['name'])
```

```{python}
# Line 2: Another direct access
print("2.", student['gpa'])
```

```{python}
# Line 3: This will cause an error!
try:
    print("3.", student['grade'])
except KeyError as e:
    print("3. KeyError:", e)
```

```{python}
# Line 4: Safe access with .get()
print("4.", student.get('grade'))
```

```{python}
# Line 5: Safe access with default value
print("5.", student.get('grade', 'Not assigned'))
```

### Check 2: Dictionary Methods

Predict what these operations will produce:

```{python}
print("\n=== Dictionary Methods ===")

# What keys are in our dictionary?
print("Keys:", list(student.keys()))
```

```{python}
# What values are stored?
print("Values:", list(student.values()))
```

```{python}
# What key-value pairs exist?
print("Items:")
for key, value in student.items():
    print(f"  {key}: {value}")
```

## 🧠 Understanding Check

**Discussion Questions (2 minutes with partner):**

1. What's the difference between `student['grade']` and `student.get('grade')`?
2. When would you use `.keys()` vs `.values()` vs `.items()`?
3. Why might dictionaries be better than lists for student records?

## 🔍 Nested Dictionary Exploration

Real-world data is often more complex. Let's explore nested structures:

```{python}
# Enhanced student record with nested data
enhanced_student = {
    'personal_info': {
        'name': 'Alice Johnson',
        'age': 19,
        'email': 'alice.johnson@university.edu'
    },
    'academic_info': {
        'major': 'Business Information Systems',
        'gpa': 3.7,
        'year': 'Second Year',
        'credits_completed': 48
    },
    'current_courses': {
        'ISYS2001': {
            'name': 'Introduction to Business Programming',
            'credits': 6,
            'grade': 'In Progress'
        },
        'MATH1001': {
            'name': 'Mathematics for Business',
            'credits': 6,
            'grade': 'A-'
        },
        'ECON1001': {
            'name': 'Economics Principles',
            'credits': 6,
            'grade': 'B+'
        }
    }
}

print("Enhanced student record loaded!")
print(f"Student: {enhanced_student['personal_info']['name']}")
```

### Nested Access Practice

```{python}
print("=== Nested Access Examples ===")

# Access nested information
print(f"Name: {enhanced_student['personal_info']['name']}")
print(f"Major: {enhanced_student['academic_info']['major']}")
print(f"GPA: {enhanced_student['academic_info']['gpa']}")
print(f"Email: {enhanced_student['personal_info']['email']}")
```

### Your Turn: Safe Nested Access

Complete these exercises using safe access methods:

```{python}
print("\n=== Your Turn: Safe Nested Access ===")

# Exercise 1: Safely get the student's phone number (which doesn't exist)
# TODO: Use nested .get() calls to safely access personal_info -> phone
phone = None  # Replace with your safe access code
print(f"Phone: {phone}")
```

```{python}
# Exercise 2: Safely get a grade for PHIL1001 (which doesn't exist)
# TODO: Safely access current_courses -> PHIL1001 -> grade
phil_grade = None  # Replace with your safe access code
print(f"Philosophy grade: {phil_grade}")
```

```{python}
# Exercise 3: Get all course names from current_courses
print("Current courses:")
# TODO: Loop through current_courses and print course names
# Hint: Use .items() and access the nested 'name' field

```

**Solutions (run after trying above):**

```{python}
print("=== SOLUTIONS ===")

# Solution 1: Safe phone access
phone = enhanced_student.get('personal_info', {}).get('phone', 'Not provided')
print(f"Phone: {phone}")

# Solution 2: Safe grade access for non-existent course
phil_grade = enhanced_student.get('current_courses', {}).get('PHIL1001', {}).get('grade', 'Not enrolled')
print(f"Philosophy grade: {phil_grade}")

# Solution 3: All course names
print("Current courses:")
courses = enhanced_student.get('current_courses', {})
for course_code, course_info in courses.items():
    course_name = course_info.get('name', 'Unknown')
    print(f"  {course_code}: {course_name}")
```

## 🎯 Mini Challenges

Work with your partner to solve these quick challenges:

### Challenge 1: Calculate Total Credits

```{python}
print("=== Challenge 1: Total Credits ===")

# TODO: Calculate total credits from current_courses
# Each course has a 'credits' field
total_credits = 0

# Your code here:


print(f"Total credits this semester: {total_credits}")
```

### Challenge 2: Grade Point Analysis

```{python}
print("=== Challenge 2: Grade Analysis ===")

# Grade point values
grade_points = {
    'A+': 4.0, 'A': 4.0, 'A-': 3.7,
    'B+': 3.3, 'B': 3.0, 'B-': 2.7,
    'C+': 2.3, 'C': 2.0, 'C-': 1.7,
    'D': 1.0, 'F': 0.0, 'In Progress': None
}

# TODO: Find courses with completed grades (not "In Progress")
completed_courses = []

# Your code here:


print("Completed courses:")
for course in completed_courses:
    print(f"  - {course}")
```

### Challenge 3: Student Summary

```{python}
print("=== Challenge 3: Student Summary ===")

# TODO: Create a summary function that prints:
# - Student name and major
# - Current GPA
# - Number of courses this semester
# - Total credits this semester

def print_student_summary(student_data):
    # Your code here
    pass

# Test your function
print_student_summary(enhanced_student)
```

**Challenge Solutions:**

```{python}
print("=== CHALLENGE SOLUTIONS ===")

# Solution 1: Total Credits
total_credits = 0
for course_info in enhanced_student['current_courses'].values():
    total_credits += course_info.get('credits', 0)
print(f"Total credits this semester: {total_credits}")

# Solution 2: Completed courses
completed_courses = []
for course_code, course_info in enhanced_student['current_courses'].items():
    grade = course_info.get('grade')
    if grade and grade != 'In Progress':
        completed_courses.append(course_code)

print("Completed courses:")
for course in completed_courses:
    print(f"  - {course}")

# Solution 3: Student Summary
def print_student_summary(student_data):
    name = student_data['personal_info']['name']
    major = student_data['academic_info']['major']
    gpa = student_data['academic_info']['gpa']
    
    courses = student_data['current_courses']
    num_courses = len(courses)
    
    total_credits = sum(course['credits'] for course in courses.values())
    
    print(f"\n📊 STUDENT SUMMARY")
    print(f"Name: {name}")
    print(f"Major: {major}")
    print(f"Current GPA: {gpa}")
    print(f"Courses this semester: {num_courses}")
    print(f"Total credits: {total_credits}")

print_student_summary(enhanced_student)
```
