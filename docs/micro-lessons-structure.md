Based on the information provided and best practices for educational content, presenting this micro lesson in multiple formats would be most effective. Here's a recommendation for how to approach this:

1. Jupyter Notebook:
Present the lesson in a Jupyter Notebook, which allows for an interactive, hands-on experience. This aligns with the principle that "writing code is the best way to learn how to code" [1]. The notebook can include:

• Explanatory text about the `print()` function
• Code cells with examples
• Interactive exercises for students to try

2. Short Video (2-3 minutes):
Create a brief video demonstration that complements the Jupyter Notebook [5][6]. The video should:

• Show the instructor typing and running the `print("Hello, World!")` code
• Include enthusiastic narration explaining the concept
• Use on-screen annotations to highlight key points
• End with a call-to-action for students to try it themselves

3. Text-based Lesson:
Provide a concise, written version of the lesson for students who prefer reading or need a quick reference.

By offering these three formats, you cater to different learning styles and reinforce the concept through multiple channels. This approach allows students to:

• Read the concept (text-based lesson)
• See and hear it explained (video)
• Practice it hands-on (Jupyter Notebook)

For the follow-up exercises, incorporate them into the Jupyter Notebook as additional cells where students can experiment with variations like:

• Printing a single character
• Creating a weather-related greeting
• Personalizing the output with their name

This multi-modal approach adheres to best practices for educational videos [5][6] while leveraging the interactive capabilities of Jupyter Notebooks [2][3]. It also sets the stage for more complex concepts as students progress towards building their weather dashboard over the 12-week course.
