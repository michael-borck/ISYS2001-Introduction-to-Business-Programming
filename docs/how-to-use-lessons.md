Study each lesson for 5-10 minutes, then immediately practice with the online exercises for 10-15 minutes, followed by a break to enhance retention.

Use a physical keyboard for coding exercises, as mobile devices are not suitable for learning to code effectively.

Follow the precise formatting and syntax instructions, even if they seem overly strict, as this helps develop attention to detail crucial for coding.

Commit to short, focused 15-25 minute study sessions to master Python fundamentals, rather than attempting to absorb large amounts of information at once.

This learning method combines reading with interactive online exercises, promising faster learning and longer retention of Python concepts.

Immediate practice after reading embeds knowledge in long-term memory, with instant feedback correcting mistakes like a one-on-one teacher.

The approach keeps you engaged and motivated, making the learning process more interesting and less boring.

Read-then-practice ensures true understanding and retention, avoiding the self-deception often associated with passive reading or highlighting.

This method builds a solid foundation of Python knowledge, preparing learners for more advanced concepts in later chapters.
