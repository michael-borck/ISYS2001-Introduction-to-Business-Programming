## Python Variables: A Micro Lesson

In Python, variables are like containers that hold information. Let's explore how they work:

**Basic Concept:**
```python
favorite_color = "blue"
print(favorite_color)
```
This code creates a variable `favorite_color` and assigns it the value "blue". When we print the variable, Python displays: `blue`

**Key Points:**
• Variables store data for later use in your program.
• You can name variables almost anything, but choose names that make sense.
• Variable names can't contain spaces or start with numbers.

**Changing Values:**
Variables can be updated:
```python
age = 25
print(age)  # Outputs: 25
age = 26
print(age)  # Now outputs: 26
```

**Variables vs. Strings:**
• Variables are not enclosed in quotes: `name = "Alice"`
• Strings (text) are always in quotes: `"Hello, World!"`

**Using Variables in print():**
```python
greeting = "Welcome to Python!"
print(greeting)
```
This displays: `Welcome to Python!`

**Remember:**
• Python doesn't care about variable names, but clear names help you and others understand your code.
• Follow naming conventions: use lowercase with underscores for readability.

Practice creating and using variables to reinforce these concepts!
