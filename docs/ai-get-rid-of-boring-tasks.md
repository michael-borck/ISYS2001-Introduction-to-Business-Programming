# Getting Rid of Boring Tasks

Coding often involves repetitive and tedious tasks that can be boring and
time-consuming. AI can handle these tasks for you, allowing you to focus on the
fun and creative parts of coding. Here are some examples of how AI can help:

1. **Formatting Code:** AI can automatically arrange your code neatly according to standard rules, so you don't have to worry about it.
2. **Improving Code Structure:** AI can suggest ways to reorganize your code to make it cleaner and easier to understand without changing what it does.
3. **Testing:** AI can create and run tests on your code to find mistakes and suggest fixes, saving you time and effort.
4. **Writing Documentation:** AI can help write explanations and comments for your code, making it easier for others (and your future self) to understand.

By taking over these tasks, AI not only saves time but also helps reduce mistakes, leading to more efficient and reliable coding.
